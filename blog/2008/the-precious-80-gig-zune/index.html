I dunno, but it was made by iRiver; good company), but I bought the floor model for $30.   Heh heh.   It was sweet, but phased out by the digital music revolution.   So, now I am happy, I bought the biggest hard drive that they make in the Zune, so I will be set for a looooong time.   80 gigs is a good amount of storage space.\u003c/p\u003e"
