<p>I was reading a post by <a href="http://www.morningtoast.com/2009/01/warning-i-have-military-madness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Morning Toast</a> about his renewed interest in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn-based_strategy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turn Based Strategy</a> games and it got my hankering for some TBS as well.   I love puzzle/strategy games, so it got me thinking about online games.</p>
<p>I was curious to see what was available so I ran a quick <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=turn+based+strategy+games+online&btnG=Search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">search on Google</a>.   I started scanning the results, but stopped at the second item on the list. It read, &quot;Award winning turn based multi-player strategy game on Weewar.com.&quot;   Well... that deserves a click!</p>

<p>So, I clicked over to <em>Games</em> and signed up for the first game on the list, which happened to be a beginner game.   It seems that the game can be set with a time limit on player turns - each player gets no more than anywhere from 5 minutes to three days to complete their turn.   The game I am in right now is set to one day.</p>

<p>The free account lets you play the game with basic units, terrain, buildings and playable maps.   It also only allows you to play up to four games at a time.   A pro account can be purchased for a small fee and will grant access to all units, base types, terrains, and maps.   A pro account holder can also play up to ten games at a time.   There is a difference in map creation as well - a pro account holder can create and store more maps than a free account.</p>
<p>I found out that the game has been around since March of 2007, but it gained a lot of notoriety in early Summer of 2007 after being mentioned on big blogs like <a href="http://kotaku.com/271729/timewaster-of-the-day-weewar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kotaku</a> and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/06/02/weewar-for-the-weekend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tech Crunch</a>.   It's been mentioned in magazines as well.   The funny thing is that I never heard of it until I ran my Google search.</p>
<p>The game is fun, the people are actually very friendly, and the site is easy to use.   Players offer a very hard challenge, which I enjoy after decades of playing the &quot;computer&quot;.   If some players don't want to play another human, some users have created their own AI and allow anyone to invite them into a game.   Although, it doesn't sound like many of these AIs offer a good challenge.</p>
<p>The game is fun and addicting, it will be my crack for the foreseeable future.</p>
