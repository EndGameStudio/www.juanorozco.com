Â  I can understand why, it's a simple class for beginners but also complex enough for experts. Â  I don't like doing what everybody else is doing, so I chose a Rogue instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWell, I finally gave in a few months ago. Â  I made a troll hunter and named him Asbestos. Â  My server went up for a free transfer and I chose to transfer all my characters to a different server, when I did, I had to change his name to \u003cspan\u003eCavemon\u003c/span\u003e since Asbestos was already taken on the new server.\u003cbr /\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI really want to create a complete back story for all my \u003cspan\u003etoons\u003c/span\u003e, but for now I just want to show off my little cat collection and give a small role-playing background too.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"spanspanp\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n  \u003cfigure style=\"width: 192px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"\u003e\u003cimg title=\"Cavemon and Pringles\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3085/3131950315_b669faf774_m.jpg?resize=192%2C240\" alt=\"Cavemon and Pringles\" width=\"192\" height=\"240\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003eCavemon and Pringles\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n  Pringles the Ghost Saber\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n  \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e \n  \u003cp\u003e\n    \u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePringles\u003c/span\u003e was really the reason why I wanted a hunter. Â  He is a ghost saber, which is why he is somewhat transparent. Â  No other cat in the game uses this texture - when not in stealth. Â  That's why I wanted him, because of his unique coloring and transparency. Â  He's a cool cat, too, listens pretty good. Â  Loves his stomach being rubbed, which is weird because he is a ghost cat...\u003c/span\u003e\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n    \u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCiriana\u003c/span\u003e was surprised that I didn't name \u003cspan\u003ePringles\u003c/span\u003e after my real-life cat: \u003cspan\u003eJefe\u003c/span\u003e. Â  I didn't think \u003cspan\u003ePringles\u003c/span\u003e looked like \u003cspan\u003eJefe\u003c/span\u003e at all, so I decided he needed a random name. Â  There was a tube of \u003cspan\u003epringles\u003c/span\u003e on my desk and I thought it would make a neat name for a cat. Â  He is my favorite pet, but I am trying to focus on my tanking pet while I am questing on my own.\u003cbr /\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003ch3\u003e\n    \u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eJefe the Night Saber\u003cbr /\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n  \u003c/h3\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n    \u003cspan\u003eSo after \u003cspan\u003eCiriana\u003c/span\u003e made me feel bad for not having a cat like my \u003cspan\u003eJefe\u003c/span\u003e, I went out and found a striped cat. Â  For those that don't know, \u003cspan\u003eJefe\u003c/span\u003e - or \u003cspan\u003eJefe'n\u003c/span\u003e as we now call him thanks to \u003cspan\u003eCiri's\u003c/span\u003e four year old brother- is a trouble maker. Â  I think he is half \u003cspan\u003esavannah\u003c/span\u003e because his stomach has spots and his fur is very soft, otherwise he is all tabby.\u003c/span\u003e\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n    \u003cfigure style=\"width: 192px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"\u003e\u003cimg title=\"Cavemon and Jefe\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3106/3131950169_14e48c850e_m.jpg?resize=192%2C240\" alt=\"Cavemon and Jefe\" width=\"192\" height=\"240\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003eCavemon and Jefe\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n    \u003cspan\u003eSo the virtual \u003cspan\u003eJefe\u003c/span\u003e is a young cat with ADD and an affinity for causing trouble. Â  He loves taunting and annoying \u003cspan\u003ePringles\u003c/span\u003e by running through him. Â  He also likes carrying \u003cspan\u003eCiri\u003c/span\u003e, my pet crab, around pretending he is going to eat him.\u003c/span\u003e\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n    He is quite the handful.\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003ch3\u003e\n    \u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCiri the Crab\u003cbr /\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n  \u003c/h3\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n    \u003cspan\u003eCan you guess why I named my newest tanking pet \u003cspan\u003eCiri\u003c/span\u003e? Â  As I mentioned above, \u003cspan\u003eCiri\u003c/span\u003e is a crab, both in-game and in real life. Â  ðŸ˜‰ Â  I thought it was a perfect name for my new crab and \u003cspan\u003eCiriana\u003c/span\u003e does a great impression of a crab.\u003c/span\u003e\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n    \u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCiri\u003c/span\u003e the crab hates cats.

Â  Don't ask me how a crab is able to flip someone off, she just did. Â  After I tried throwing her back in the ocean, she jumped back out and followed me back to the city. Â  She is not my pet, she is just hanging around so she can kill \u003cspan\u003eJefe\u003c/span\u003e.

<p>I started a new character a while back, a hunter this time. Â  I avoided the hunter class because a good portion of players chose it over any other class. Â  I can understand why, it's a simple class for beginners but also complex enough for experts. Â  I don't like doing what everybody else is doing, so I chose a Rogue instead.</p>
<p><span>Well, I finally gave in a few months ago. Â  I made a troll hunter and named him Asbestos. Â  My server went up for a free transfer and I chose to transfer all my characters to a different server, when I did, I had to change his name to <span>Cavemon</span> since Asbestos was already taken on the new server.<br /> </span></p>
<p><span>I really want to create a complete back story for all my <span>toons</span>, but for now I just want to show off my little cat collection and give a small role-playing background too.</span></p>
<h3 id="spanspanp"><span><span></p></h3>
<p>
  <figure style="width: 192px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img title="Cavemon and Pringles" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3085/3131950315_b669faf774_m.jpg?resize=192%2C240" alt="Cavemon and Pringles" width="192" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Cavemon and Pringles</figcaption></figure>
</p>
<p>
  Pringles the Ghost Saber
</p>
<p>
  </span></span></h3> 
  <p>
    <span><span>Pringles</span> was really the reason why I wanted a hunter. Â  He is a ghost saber, which is why he is somewhat transparent. Â  No other cat in the game uses this texture - when not in stealth. Â  That's why I wanted him, because of his unique coloring and transparency. Â  He's a cool cat, too, listens pretty good. Â  Loves his stomach being rubbed, which is weird because he is a ghost cat...</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span><span>Ciriana</span> was surprised that I didn't name <span>Pringles</span> after my real-life cat: <span>Jefe</span>. Â  I didn't think <span>Pringles</span> looked like <span>Jefe</span> at all, so I decided he needed a random name. Â  There was a tube of <span>pringles</span> on my desk and I thought it would make a neat name for a cat. Â  He is my favorite pet, but I am trying to focus on my tanking pet while I am questing on my own.<br /> </span>
  </p>
  <h3>
    <span><span>Jefe the Night Saber<br /> </span></span>
  </h3>
  <p>
    <span>So after <span>Ciriana</span> made me feel bad for not having a cat like my <span>Jefe</span>, I went out and found a striped cat. Â  For those that don't know, <span>Jefe</span> - or <span>Jefe'n</span> as we now call him thanks to <span>Ciri's</span> four year old brother- is a trouble maker. Â  I think he is half <span>savannah</span> because his stomach has spots and his fur is very soft, otherwise he is all tabby.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <figure style="width: 192px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img title="Cavemon and Jefe" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3106/3131950169_14e48c850e_m.jpg?resize=192%2C240" alt="Cavemon and Jefe" width="192" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Cavemon and Jefe</figcaption></figure>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>So the virtual <span>Jefe</span> is a young cat with ADD and an affinity for causing trouble. Â  He loves taunting and annoying <span>Pringles</span> by running through him. Â  He also likes carrying <span>Ciri</span>, my pet crab, around pretending he is going to eat him.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    He is quite the handful.
  </p>
  <h3>
    <span><span>Ciri the Crab<br /> </span></span>
  </h3>
  <p>
    <span>Can you guess why I named my newest tanking pet <span>Ciri</span>? Â  As I mentioned above, <span>Ciri</span> is a crab, both in-game and in real life. Â  ðŸ˜‰ Â  I thought it was a perfect name for my new crab and <span>Ciriana</span> does a great impression of a crab.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span><span>Ciri</span> the crab hates cats. Â  I found her on a fishing trip in <span>Duratar</span> after she gave <span>Jefe</span> the one finger salute. Â  Don't ask me how a crab is able to flip someone off, she just did. Â  After I tried throwing her back in the ocean, she jumped back out and followed me back to the city. Â  She is not my pet, she is just hanging around so she can kill <span>Jefe</span>. Â  Something about Jefe eating her family.</span>

    </p>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;
  Izzy the Gorilla&lt;/h3&gt; 
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ok&lt;/span&gt;, so I don't really have a pet named Izzy just yet, but I will! Â  I'm going to get a gorilla as soon as I am leveled enough. Â  We call Izzy a little monkey and I thought it would be fun to have a gorilla named after Izzy in the game. Â  I know that gorillas aren't monkeys, but it's still funny.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;The gorilla I want is a baby gorilla, but from what I am reading it is untamable. Â  Which really sucks - it would be perfect since I am naming it after a baby. Â  I'll just have to find another gorilla that is somewhat cute.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;Most likely I will have to get rid of my crab once I do get a gorilla since I don't have enough gold to keep so many pets in the stables.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;h3&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;figure id=&quot;attachment_1286&quot; aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-1286&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://petopia.brashendeavors.net/html/families/family_spiritbeast.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-1286&quot; title=&quot;harkoa&quot; src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/guamaso.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/harkoa-300x300.jpg?resize=300%2C300&quot; alt=&quot;Jefe Rebooted&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;caption-attachment-1286&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Jefe Rebooted&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Jefe: Rebooted
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
      
      &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://petopia.brashendeavors.net/index.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Petopia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a great reference for Hunters that need detailed info on the different pets in World of &lt;span&gt;Warcraft&lt;/span&gt;. Â  Since I don't have the newest patch- Wrath of the &lt;span&gt;Lich&lt;/span&gt; King - I didn't know they introduced new pets like rhinos and spirit beasts. Â  Â  After reading through Petopia I found out that the only spirit beast currently &lt;span&gt;tamable&lt;/span&gt; by Hunters is &quot;&lt;span&gt;Loque'naha&lt;/span&gt;.&quot; Â  He's basically a cat, but with some different moves and an awesome coloring scheme!&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;I will role play this by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; either&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; just adding him to my troupe, or by making &lt;span&gt;Jefe&lt;/span&gt; into this cat. Â  I will release the cat I have now and rename this new one.&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;The story will be something like &lt;span&gt;Jefe was&lt;/span&gt; hit by a car and the only doctor opened at the time was some crazy undead dude that turned him into a glowing bad-ass super cat.&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;This is a long ways away, since the beast is a level 76 elite and Cavemon Â  just barely leveled to 25. Â  I probably won't be able to tame this pet until at least level 75 and only with the help of others. Â  Plus he is a rare pet that only shows up every now and then.&lt;/span&gt;
