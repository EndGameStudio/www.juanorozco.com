      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, the company I worked for, Shortcut, underwent another round of layoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First of all, I had a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of fun at Shortcut. I learned a ton. And we built some cool shit. In the two and half years I was there, I started on our monetization team, adding growth features like our Labs feature and then switching gears to work on billing architecture. I eventually moved to our Docs team, where I helped bring our Docs product out of beta so teams could document knowledge and decisions better. I&#39;m incredibly proud of my time at Shortcut and highly grateful for all the opportunities I had to improve myself. I left Shortcut being a better person, a better technical knowledge worker, and a better leader. I&#39;m really excited about that next adventure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This evening, I stared a bit longer in the mirror; at my hairline. I think my hair visibly thinned over the weekend. My hairline isn&#39;t something I fret over; it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; moving, but I can&#39;t do anything about it. I&#39;m trying to be more of a Stoicist in my 40s; I&#39;m trying to be more, you know, &amp;quot;WWMAD&amp;quot;? I&#39;m starting to wonder if the last few years would try even Marcus Aurelius&#39; dedication to calm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
