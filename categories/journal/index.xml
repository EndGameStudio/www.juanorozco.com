      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, the company I worked for, Shortcut, underwent another round of layoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First of all, I had a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of fun at Shortcut. I learned a ton. And we built some cool shit. In the two and half years I was there, I started on our monetization team, adding growth features like our Labs feature and then switching gears to work on billing architecture. I eventually moved to our Docs team, where I helped bring our Docs product out of beta so teams could document knowledge and decisions better. I&#39;m incredibly proud of my time at Shortcut and highly grateful for all the opportunities I had to improve myself. I left Shortcut being a better person, a better technical knowledge worker, and a better leader. I&#39;m really excited about that next adventure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
