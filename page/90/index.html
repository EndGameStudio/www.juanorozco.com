        <figure style="width: 200px" class="wp-caption alignleft">[<img title="Have a little war at Weewar.com" src="https://i0.wp.com/weewar.com/images/weewar200.jpg?resize=200%2C200" alt="Weewar.com" width="200" height="200" data-recalc-dims="1" />][1]<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Weewar.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>I was reading a post by <a href="http://www.morningtoast.com/2009/01/warning-i-have-military-madness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Morning Toast</a> about his renewed interest in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn-based_strategy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turn Based Strategy</a> games and it got my hankering for some TBS as well.   I love puzzle/strategy games, so it got me thinking about online games.</p>
<p>I was curious to see what was available so I ran a quick <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=turn+based+strategy+games+online&btnG=Search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">search on Google</a>.   I started scanning the results, but stopped at the second item on the list. It read, &quot;Award winning turn based multi-player strategy game on Weewar.com.&quot;   Well... that deserves a click!</p>
<p>The first thing I notice is how neat and clean the site is - very easy to use and I love easy to use!   So, I signed up for an account - they had me at &quot;free&quot; - and started poking around the site.   I thought the site would have all types of options and pages and links, but it is actually very simple.</p>
<p>So, I clicked over to <em>Games</em> and signed up for the first game on the list, which happened to be a beginner game.   It seems that the game can be set with a time limit on player turns - each player gets no more than anywhere from 5 minutes to three days to complete their turn.   The game I am in right now is set to one day.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1408" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1408" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft">[<img class="size-medium wp-image-1408" title="gamescreengrab" src="https://i0.wp.com/guamaso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/gamescreengrab-300x291.png?resize=300%2C291" alt="My latest game" width="300" height="291" data-recalc-dims="1" />][2]<figcaption id="caption-attachment-1408" class="wp-caption-text">My latest game</figcaption></figure>
<p>Game play is simple, but deep.   You have bases that can create units.   Units vary in strength, armor, and movement.   Terrain ranges from mountains to forests to swamps.   There's a lot of room for strategy making.</p>
<p>The final reward for victory is an increase in points to the player's &quot;rating.&quot;   The rating system awards winners by transferring points from the loser to the winner.   You start off with 1500 points.   The game I am in is a 3 player map and the third player just gave up, which rewarded me with 10 points.   Woo hoo!</p>
<p>There's a neat social aspect to the game as well.   There is a chat client as you are playing so you can taunt your opponent or, if you're like me, discuss strategies.   There's a forum, blog, and API as well.   A special tournament site exists where you can take part in a tournament of WeeWar.   Good stuff.</p>
<p>The free account lets you play the game with basic units, terrain, buildings and playable maps.   It also only allows you to play up to four games at a time.   A pro account can be purchased for a small fee and will grant access to all units, base types, terrains, and maps.   A pro account holder can also play up to ten games at a time.   There is a difference in map creation as well - a pro account holder can create and store more maps than a free account.</p>
<p>I found out that the game has been around since March of 2007, but it gained a lot of notoriety in early Summer of 2007 after being mentioned on big blogs like <a href="http://kotaku.com/271729/timewaster-of-the-day-weewar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kotaku</a> and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/06/02/weewar-for-the-weekend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tech Crunch</a>.   It's been mentioned in magazines as well.   The funny thing is that I never heard of it until I ran my Google search.</p>
<p>The game is fun, the people are actually very friendly, and the site is easy to use.   Players offer a very hard challenge, which I enjoy after decades of playing the &quot;computer&quot;.   If some players don't want to play another human, some users have created their own AI and allow anyone to invite them into a game.   Although, it doesn't sound like many of these AIs offer a good challenge.</p>
<p>The game is fun and addicting, it will be my crack for the foreseeable future.</p>

        <p>I started a new character a while back, a hunter this time.   I avoided the hunter class because a good portion of players chose it over any other class.   I can understand why, it's a simple class for beginners but also complex enough for experts.   I don't like doing what everybody else is doing, so I chose a Rogue instead.</p>
<p><span>Well, I finally gave in a few months ago.   I made a troll hunter and named him Asbestos.   My server went up for a free transfer and I chose to transfer all my characters to a different server, when I did, I had to change his name to <span>Cavemon</span> since Asbestos was already taken on the new server.<br /> </span></p>
<p><span>I really want to create a complete back story for all my <span>toons</span>, but for now I just want to show off my little cat collection and give a small role-playing background too.</span></p>
<h3><span><span></p></h3>
<p>
  <figure style="width: 192px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img title="Cavemon and Pringles" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3085/3131950315_b669faf774_m.jpg?resize=192%2C240" alt="Cavemon and Pringles" width="192" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Cavemon and Pringles</figcaption></figure>
</p>
<p>
  Pringles the Ghost Saber
</p>
<p>
  </span></span></h3> 
  <p>
    <span><span>Pringles</span> was really the reason why I wanted a hunter.   He is a ghost saber, which is why he is somewhat transparent.   No other cat in the game uses this texture - when not in stealth.   That's why I wanted him, because of his unique coloring and transparency.   He's a cool cat, too, listens pretty good.   Loves his stomach being rubbed, which is weird because he is a ghost cat...</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span><span>Ciriana</span> was surprised that I didn't name <span>Pringles</span> after my real-life cat: <span>Jefe</span>.   I didn't think <span>Pringles</span> looked like <span>Jefe</span> at all, so I decided he needed a random name.   There was a tube of <span>pringles</span> on my desk and I thought it would make a neat name for a cat.   He is my favorite pet, but I am trying to focus on my tanking pet while I am questing on my own.<br /> </span>
  </p>
  <h3>
    <span><span>Jefe the Night Saber<br /> </span></span>
  </h3>
  <p>
    <span>So after <span>Ciriana</span> made me feel bad for not having a cat like my <span>Jefe</span>, I went out and found a striped cat.   For those that don't know, <span>Jefe</span> - or <span>Jefe'n</span> as we now call him thanks to <span>Ciri's</span> four year old brother- is a trouble maker.   I think he is half <span>savannah</span> because his stomach has spots and his fur is very soft, otherwise he is all tabby.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <figure style="width: 192px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img title="Cavemon and Jefe" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3106/3131950169_14e48c850e_m.jpg?resize=192%2C240" alt="Cavemon and Jefe" width="192" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Cavemon and Jefe</figcaption></figure>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>So the virtual <span>Jefe</span> is a young cat with ADD and an affinity for causing trouble.   He loves taunting and annoying <span>Pringles</span> by running through him.   He also likes carrying <span>Ciri</span>, my pet crab, around pretending he is going to eat him.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    He is quite the handful.
  </p>
  <h3>
    <span><span>Ciri the Crab<br /> </span></span>
  </h3>
  <p>
    <span>Can you guess why I named my newest tanking pet <span>Ciri</span>?   As I mentioned above, <span>Ciri</span> is a crab, both in-game and in real life.   😉   I thought it was a perfect name for my new crab and <span>Ciriana</span> does a great impression of a crab.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span><span>Ciri</span> the crab hates cats.   I found her on a fishing trip in <span>Duratar</span> after she gave <span>Jefe</span> the one finger salute.   Don't ask me how a crab is able to flip someone off, she just did.   After I tried throwing her back in the ocean, she jumped back out and followed me back to the city.   She is not my pet, she is just hanging around so she can kill <span>Jefe</span>.   Something about Jefe eating her family.</span>

    </p>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;
  Izzy the Gorilla&lt;/h3&gt; 
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ok&lt;/span&gt;, so I don't really have a pet named Izzy just yet, but I will!   I'm going to get a gorilla as soon as I am leveled enough.   We call Izzy a little monkey and I thought it would be fun to have a gorilla named after Izzy in the game.   I know that gorillas aren't monkeys, but it's still funny.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;The gorilla I want is a baby gorilla, but from what I am reading it is untamable.   Which really sucks - it would be perfect since I am naming it after a baby.   I'll just have to find another gorilla that is somewhat cute.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;Most likely I will have to get rid of my crab once I do get a gorilla since I don't have enough gold to keep so many pets in the stables.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;h3&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;figure id=&quot;attachment_1286&quot; aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-1286&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://petopia.brashendeavors.net/html/families/family_spiritbeast.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-1286&quot; title=&quot;harkoa&quot; src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/guamaso.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/harkoa-300x300.jpg?resize=300%2C300&quot; alt=&quot;Jefe Rebooted&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;caption-attachment-1286&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Jefe Rebooted&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Jefe: Rebooted
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
      
      &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://petopia.brashendeavors.net/index.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Petopia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a great reference for Hunters that need detailed info on the different pets in World of &lt;span&gt;Warcraft&lt;/span&gt;.   Since I don't have the newest patch- Wrath of the &lt;span&gt;Lich&lt;/span&gt; King - I didn't know they introduced new pets like rhinos and spirit beasts.     After reading through Petopia I found out that the only spirit beast currently &lt;span&gt;tamable&lt;/span&gt; by Hunters is &quot;&lt;span&gt;Loque'naha&lt;/span&gt;.&quot;   He's basically a cat, but with some different moves and an awesome coloring scheme!&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;I will role play this by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; either&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; just adding him to my troupe, or by making &lt;span&gt;Jefe&lt;/span&gt; into this cat.   I will release the cat I have now and rename this new one.&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;The story will be something like &lt;span&gt;Jefe was&lt;/span&gt; hit by a car and the only doctor opened at the time was some crazy undead dude that turned him into a glowing bad-ass super cat.&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;This is a long ways away, since the beast is a level 76 elite and Cavemon   just barely leveled to 25.   I probably won't be able to tame this pet until at least level 75 and only with the help of others.   Plus he is a rare pet that only shows up every now and then.&lt;/span&gt;

<p>We just watched The Dark Knight Sunday night after an afternoon of tamale making and gorging.   We had Ciri's dad, step-mom, and step-grandma over, so we had a nice assembly line going.   After they left, we sat on the couch and popped in The Dark Knight.</p>
<p>I wanted to watch this movie way before Heath Ledger died, and it sucks that some people have hyped it up based on it being Ledger's last performance.   I wanted to watch it because the first one was great and because Heath Ledger was, at the very least, an interesting choice for The Joker.</p>
<p>I grew up with Jack Nicholson's Joker; people before me grew up with Cesar Romero and his mustache.   Right away, people started comparing the three actors' interpretations of the Joker.   This is a natural reaction, albeit a flawed reaction.   I am partial to Jack Nicholson's rendition, but I don't think that it is fair to compare the three since they all took place during different periods of American culture.   Apples and oranges.</p>
<p>I wanted to believe the hype, but people these days are so eager to jump on some bandwagon or another.   I resisted believing everybody's opinion until I saw the movie for myself.</p>
<p>So Ciri and I finally got a chance to sit down and watch the movie after we put Izzy down for bed.   I don't want to review the movie, except I do want to say that without Heath Ledger, the movie would have been crap.   Period.</p>
<p>In the scene where he is robbing the bank we get our first meeting with the Joker.   This single, short scene gave me chills.   I could not believe what I was seeing.   He did meet the hype - in Ciri's unbiased opinion, he actually exceeded it.   He was really a bad ass Joker.</p>
<p>This brought up so many questions, though.   Is his Joker the best live action Joker?   Is his performance really worth a nomination or even an award?   For the former, you can't say his is the best.   You just can't.   Go back to the 80's and relive the hype of Jack's Joker and tell me they can be compared.   No way.</p>
<p>As for the nomination.   He was good.   Damn good.   He brought something to the Joker that none of his predecessors could, and he did it right.   Not just &quot;good&quot;, but &quot;right.&quot;   Ciri and I went back and analyzed many other villains from comic book movies.   William Dafoe bombed in Spiderman, I think.   Kevin Spacey was pretty good, but it wasn't anything amazing.   There's more, but you get the point.</p>
<p>I was hesitant to say he deserves an award at first because I thought it would be marred with the extra hype his performance received after his death.   If he hadn't died, would people still think he deserved an award?   Maybe not as many people would think so, but overall, I'm convinced he earned an award.</p>
<p>We decided that Heath Ledger's Joker, was by far the best performance of all the other superhero flicks.   And not only was he the best, but he also set a very, very high bar for any actor that wants to play a villain after this.</p>
