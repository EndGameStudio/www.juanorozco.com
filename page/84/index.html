        <p>I’ve been fighting some demons lately.  No, not drugs or anything like that. Never.  Kids are great. Wife is healthy. No, it’s nothing like that. Let’s just say we’re going through some emotional times right now.  That’s the problem with life, sometimes she can be a real pain.  Well, either way, our lot in life is to soldier on and that’s what we’re doing.</p>
<p>The unfortunate side effect to this is a slight emotional downer.  I hate letting life affect my emotions for so long.  Poop happens and we adjust – being emotional doesn’t help any.</p>
<p>So, how do we cope?  How do we set our path back to the direction we wanted it to be?  Everyone has their own way, but mine is through creativity. (You should’ve seen that one coming! HA!)</p>
<p>The last time I painted with <a href="http://twitpic.com/4psx1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">watercolors was for the Mothers day gift</a> I made. That was a lot of fun and extremely relaxing. So what the heck, why not. I brought out my supplies, tore out a couple of pages and started painting…</p>
<p>The first one, “Power” isn’t done yet. I want to draw an open hand in the center. The hand will look like as if it was clasping a light source.  Kinda like a <a href="http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Kamehameha" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kamehameha</a> wave.</p>
<p>The second is called <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/theguamaso/3712104372/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Battle Between Good and Evil</a>, it’s an expression of what I feel inside.  Overcome, surrounded, weary… ok that’s enough… I’m starting to sound all emo-ish!  Blah.  Anyway, this one took up most of my time and you can probably tell it’s my favorite so far.</p>
<p>One day I hope to be able to paint more detail, for now gradients, patterns, and simple washes are my outlet. As you can see that's exactly what I've done.  These two pieces took me a couple hours and I am really happy with the outcome.</p>
<p>So, emotions manifesting in some medium or another, be it through writing, painting, photography, whatever, are great muses.  It’s also a great way to relax!  It works for me.  Next time, I’ll try some shapes and stuff. 😛</p>

<p>Yesterday was <a href="http://wordcamprdu.com/2009/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WordCamp RDU</a> at NCCU's School of Education.  Being my first Camp of any kind, the night before I searched for ideas and tips on <a href="http://themeplayground.com/2009/community/wordcamp-prep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what I should prepare</a> for.  The first article I found had three basic points.  The most important to me was something I didn't think of: be prepared with questions for the speaker.  I knew I would get to ask questions, but I didn't think to have them prepared beforehand.  It's the simple things that we miss.</p>
<p>I spent all evening trying to come up with some questions and I kept arriving to the same question for all the speakers.  How do you get creative?  Then, I thought, if I could only ask one person this question it would be <a href="http://ma.tt">Matt Mullenweg</a>.  I did get to talk to him for a brief moment, but I'll get to that in a bit.</p>
<p>So Saturday morning I met up with a friend of mine from NC State and we headed out for the school.  From the very beginning I could tell we were going to have fun.  The volunteers were friendly and helpful.  <a href="http://daniellebaldwin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Danielle Baldwin</a>, one of the people responsible for the event, did a great job.  It was like they had done it before and yet, this was the first Raleigh/Durham WordCamp.</p>
<p>The other participants were really great too.  (Well, except for a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/theguamaso/3621550127/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">couple of rude people</a>. Yes I am linking that image, that guy was <em>rude</em>.) I met a couple of awesome writers and fellow geeks.  The dynamics were all over the place as well; old, young, experienced, beginners... everything.  It was awesome how this dynamic didn't matter, everyone had a great time sharing their thoughts and experiences on WordPress and what they use it for.</p>
<p>There were two sets of presentations, sometimes three at a time, and a few of them were difficult to choose between.  For one time slot it was between Copyright tips, WordPress as a CMS, or Videoblogging.  Of the three I was more interested in Copyright Tips and Videoblogging, but you can see the difficulty in choosing from the three.  All very good and interesting sessions.</p>
<p>The best presentation of the day, in my opinion, was given by <a href="http://www.andybeal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Andy Beal</a> about SEO.  My SEO is pretty weak 'cause SEO and I have issues. 🙂  Andy's zeal about the subject, along with some great questions by other antendees, really helped me understand it more.  He's a pretty rad speaker.</p>
<p>The keynote for the day was by WordPress creator, Matt Mullenweg.  I have a thing about presentations: the slides are not que cards.  I don't like it when people just read off the slides and offer no other comment or conversation about what they put on the slide.  Matt had about three or four slides with only a few words of text.  Everything else came from <em>him</em>.  This, I think, is hard to do which is why people rely so much on the slides.  Matt was inspiring to say the least with is presentation and his thoughts.  He's a cool dude.  It takes a big person to say they don't like their own product (He did say they are fixing it.  Actually, the new version is coming out later this month.).  Amazing guy.</p>
<p>So, during the Q and A, people were asking him questions mainly about WordPress, Automattic, and the many projects he's involved with. My question seemed out of place and I felt like asking him one on one anyway.  After the keynote, I had a chance to ask him my question.  His answer was pretty straight forward.  &quot;For starters, if I am working on a project that is on the computer, the first thing I do is get off the computer.&quot;  He does his photography and he also sketches in a moleskin for inspiration.  He mentioned the site <a href="http://www.colourlovers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ColourLovers.com</a>, which is new to me and is quickly becoming one of my favorites.  If I sound fanboy-ish, than so be it but Matt is an inspirational creative and I am glad to have met him.</p>
<p>There are a few other resources from yesterday that are starting to get posted online.  I know <a title="Wayne Suttons Presentation" href="http://socialwayne.com/2009/06/14/wordpress-twitter-plugins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wayne Sutton did an interview with Matt</a> and he recorded A LOT of <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/channel/waynesutton" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video of the event</a> too.  I saw almost everyone taking pictures and stuff, but I have yet to find any <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/wordcamprdu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Flickr</a>, save a few from myself and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/waynesutton/sets/72157619743342794/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wayne Sutton</a>.  Mine aren't that great, btw. 😉</p>
<p>So that's pretty much everything in a nutshell... a large nutshell, but a nutshell nonetheless.  It was a great time and my only complaint is I didn't win a <a href="http://shop.wordpress.net/usa/t-shirts/wordpress-olive-mens-t-shirt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WordPress shirt</a>. 🙁</p>
