      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week Ciriana told me that her Sergeant was going to give Ciriana a &amp;quot;good-bye&amp;quot; luncheon. Â  Although Ciri&#39;s official last day isn&#39;t until May, her last day in the clinic is nigh. Â  Her Sergeant asked me to send her pictures of Ciriana in a bite suit from a re-enlistment ceremony in Germany. Â  The photo was mounted onto a plaque that Ciriana received during the luncheon - it is pretty awesome looking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a quick post to explain the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/theguamaso/sets/72157615128976122/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;latest Flickr images&lt;/a&gt;. Â  The top secret gift for Ciri&#39;s party tomorrow is a Challenge Coin Display. Â  A custom display, that is. Â  Made by me. Â  That actually doesn&#39;t mean anything because without a keyboard and a mouse, my hands are worthless.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a been a while since I last wrote an entry, a little longer than I would like. Â  I have a few posts waiting to get edited, but I&#39;ve been so busy with the kid, the house, and projects that as soon as I sit down to edit my stuff, I start falling asleep. Â  ðŸ™‚&lt;/p&gt;</description>
