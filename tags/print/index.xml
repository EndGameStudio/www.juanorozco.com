      <description>&lt;p&gt;Obviously, and I called this one, the post-a-day thing did not work. Post  a week is still good to go, though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was reorganizing my photos in Picasa and I started editing some older shots I took. I wanted to see if Picasa could do some sort of HDR. Even a feux-HDR. My research took me to the collage button, a button I have long ignored.  Although my results with the semi-HDR workaround was a let down, the collage option itself piqued my curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
