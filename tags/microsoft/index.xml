Well, it&#39;s just my opinion, but from the confirmed specs listed on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zune.net/en-us/press/2009/0526-zunehd.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Microsoft&#39;s release&lt;/a&gt; about the new Zune HD, I believe it is doomed to reside in the shadow of Apple&#39;s iPod alongside the rest of it&#39;s brethren.
