Hilarious!&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The family and I finally watched Megamind the other night.  I was really impressed. The story was creative and different, but I was mostly amazed with the facial expressions –  really sucked me into the story. Also, a few weeks ago, we watched How to Train Your Dragon for the first time.  That has to be my favorite Dreamworks film to date.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A new light on my heritage.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PS/2&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-1982&#34; title=&#34;IBM_PS2&#34; src=&#34;https://i1.wp.com/creativeandflow.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/IBM_PS2_MCA_Model_55_SX_front-300x225.jpg?resize=180%2C135&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;180&#34; height=&#34;135&#34; data-recalc-dims=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I recently realized something about myself, I like being Mexican and being Mexican makes me a better creative.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, I didn’t always have this awe for my culture.  I used to hate my name and I hated where we lived even more. I explored the inner workings of Windows 3.X while the other kids played soccer in the streets. If you thought computers were bully magnets in the suburbs, imagine what the effect was on kids that grew up in lesser areas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Taking the Social Out of Social Media</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft size-medium wp-image-1946&#34; title=&#34;Follower-count&#34; src=&#34;https://i2.wp.com/creativeandflow.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Mobile-Photo-Feb-5-2010-12-43-54-AM-300x225.jpg?resize=240%2C180&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;240&#34; height=&#34;180&#34; data-recalc-dims=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;I was reading an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/01/st_thompson_obscurity/&#34;&gt;article in the latest issue of Wired magazine about community and social media&lt;/a&gt;.  The impression I was under when I discovered social media a few years ago was that it exists as a virtual community.  A place to share thoughts and ideas; to speak out and express yourself; to teach and learn.  There’s this give and take situation that all communities express during socialization that also exists within social media circles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why the Zune HD will fail.</title>
      <link>https://www.juanorozco.com/blog/2009/why-the-zune-hd-will-fail/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dramatic title, right? Well, it&#39;s just my opinion, but from the confirmed specs listed on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zune.net/en-us/press/2009/0526-zunehd.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Microsoft&#39;s release&lt;/a&gt; about the new Zune HD, I believe it is doomed to reside in the shadow of Apple&#39;s iPod alongside the rest of it&#39;s brethren. If things change between today and it&#39;s release then maybe the Zune HD has a chance. The people are eager to have choices in a Portable Media Player and therefore eager for the Zune brand to succeed. I know I am.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
