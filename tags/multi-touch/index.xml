      <description>&lt;p&gt;My questions is, how is this not mass produced yet? It seems pretty doable, right? Maybe I&#39;m just biased by the amount of want I have for it. It even picks up touch at the bend of the screen! Speaking of which, I like how they use the bend as a sort of dock, I can think of any other use for that part of the screen since it would distort the image. But, whatever, major coolness. Click through and watch the video. I&#39;d say it only needs a little more power - there&#39;s a big lag at the video game bit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
