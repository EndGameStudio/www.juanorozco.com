      <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;&#xA;  I thought for sure that the 3GS and 4 would have started to take over the 3G&#39;s spot as top camera phone on Flickr.  Interesting to see that the 3G actually increased its user base while the younger brothers are either steady or dropping.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Watched Word Wars last night. I&#39;m amazed that they have such a tolerance for drug abuse. It made me think about a point that the documentary Bigger, Faster, Stronger brought up. In order to be competitive in today&#39;s competitions, you need to be juiced up on something.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

XD&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordcamprdu.com/2009/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;WordCamp RDU&lt;/a&gt; at NCCU&#39;s School of Education.  Being my first Camp of any kind, the night before I searched for ideas and tips on &lt;a href=&#34;http://themeplayground.com/2009/community/wordcamp-prep/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;what I should prepare&lt;/a&gt; for.  The first article I found had three basic points.  The most important to me was something I didn&#39;t think of: be prepared with questions for the speaker.  I knew I would get to ask questions, but I didn&#39;t think to have them prepared beforehand.  It&#39;s the simple things that we miss.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
