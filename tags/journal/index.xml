      <description>&lt;p&gt;I remember taking the ASVAB in high school and recruiters calling me afterwards to join code breakers... apparently I showed aptitude for patterns. Goooo super ADD powers! ðŸ˜‚&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A short time later, the curiosity got to me and I went to the Marine recruiting place with questions. They showed me a video of boot camp. I thanked them for their time and never looked back. (I mean, it&#39;s called the crucible!) I learned from that video, though, to have great respect for people who CAN do those things and I defended their honor to naysayers whenever I could.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year we purchased a Ryobi cordless tool set and a Ryobi table saw. Nothing fancy but impressive upgrades from what we had... which wasn&#39;t much!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;cat-condo-project-catcondoproject&#34;&gt;Cat Condo Project {#catcondoproject}&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the past, we&#39;ve made the cats insulated homes from plastic totes. But they get nasty and nobody cleans them up so they eventually get tossed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Four Way Test</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately I have struggled with the America &amp;quot;I remember&amp;quot; versus the America &amp;quot;I see before me&amp;quot;. I am aware that there is a bias at work that paints my past as rosier than it really is. Still, when I run into words like these, I wonder where we stumbled:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Po the Pathfinder: origins</title>

I loved that car. It was simple. No crazy gadgets. No power steering. No air conditioning. No fuel injection. No power brakes. &lt;strong&gt;Just car.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I loved that car, alas, it didn&#39;t make sense to bring it back to the states with us. Unfortunately, people rarely buy those old cars so we had to junk it. My heart broke into a million pieces that day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I have a subscription to Evernote, Dropbox, Google Drive. I even keep a private Github repo available for simple text notes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Mind dump: The last few months</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s interesting how life just happens. It clichÃ© but it&#39;s true. One moment your having a margarita, the next minute you find out your little family is about to be a lot less little.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I mostly just want to mind dump some thoughts and maybe I&#39;ll elaborate on them later and maybe I won&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I&#39;ve been known to go to the store for something I need simply because I&#39;d rather not wait the week for free shipping to delivery my item.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Today was my first day doing CrossFit. Let me first get my thoughts out on CrossFit before I explain my discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;crossfit-is-bad-ass-crossfitisbadass&#34;&gt;CrossFit is bad ass {#crossfitisbadass}&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the trainer we had. She was amazing. She was empathetic yet assertive; firm yet encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As a creator of web things, I am no stranger to the concept. But as a member of society, father, husband, friend, and more; I&#39;ve noticed more and more useful applications for iteration in all aspects of life outside of work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Baking is the closest I will probably ever get to a laboratory science and I am ok with that. I love the sciences and I like laboratory science but can you eat HCl and live? Unless you have Wolverine&#39;s healing factor, I highly doubt it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Thought: Intense focus</title>
      <link>https://www.juanorozco.com/2014/07/21/thought-intense-focus/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It takes years to develop and refine a skill. It takes longer still to fix a character flaw or improve a virtue. People have proven that, with proper focus, you can turn your life around. The goal is not to change but to build discipline or values that didn&#39;t exist, or barely existed, before.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Home Automata</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The idea of walking from one room to another, talking to your family over the phone, but not tied to a device in any way. The caller&#39;s voice travels with you to each room through speakers built into the wall. Presence sensors in each room detect your movement between rooms. A sensitive microphone also embedded in each room, but processed and cleaned up by a fancy computer somewhere in the house (so your voice doesn&#39;t sound &amp;quot;far away&amp;quot;.)... &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is the future I remember being told was in store for us. Un-tethered and automated; &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Online Web Apps for private journaling.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve started up my personal journal again.Â  (Yes, I am writing a diary...)Â  Only this time, I thought I&#39;d try a virtual journal in the hopes that I would continue writing in it longer than a few months.Â  I enjoy writing and chronicling my thoughts, but writing in a book never worked out for me.Â  I would jot down my thoughts and ideas more often if I could write from anywhere and anytime.Â  What better way to write on the go than with my iPhone?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
