      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://flitterize.com/quickynote/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft&#34; src=&#34;https://i1.wp.com/flitterize.com/quickynote/iphone-icon.png?resize=57%2C57&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;57&#34; height=&#34;57&#34; data-recalc-dims=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A few weeks ago I wrote down some notes on a Post-it note at my desk. When I got up, I stuck the notes to my phone so I wouldn&#39;t forget to take them with me.  I use Evernote extensively, so I felt a little silly when i went to pick up my phone.  But then i actually gave it some though, why didn&#39;t I type my note into Evernote, or some other note taking app on my phone?  The answer came quickly, because they are just to darn slow!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Online Web Apps for private journaling.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve started up my personal journal again.  (Yes, I am writing a diary...)  Only this time, I thought I&#39;d try a virtual journal in the hopes that I would continue writing in it longer than a few months.  I enjoy writing and chronicling my thoughts, but writing in a book never worked out for me.  I would jot down my thoughts and ideas more often if I could write from anywhere and anytime.  What better way to write on the go than with my iPhone?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
