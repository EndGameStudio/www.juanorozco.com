      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s wishlist time. Last year was a pretty successful year for my annual personal holiday, I got Mario Kart, my sub-woofer, and a few other doo-dads. This year is a tough one for many people including my family and friends. I never expect gifts from them but they always ask what I want. It&#39;s also fun to just list the things I am excited about.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;figure style=&#34;width: 240px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignleft&#34;&gt;&lt;img title=&#34;Wiimote Steering wheel&#34; src=&#34;https://i1.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3284/2470954941_f9b47a07b5_m.jpg?resize=240%2C180&#34; alt=&#34;Wiimote Steering wheel&#34; width=&#34;240&#34; height=&#34;180&#34; data-recalc-dims=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Wiimote Steering wheel&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ok, so I know that it&#39;s not my birthday yet, but my mom sent me Mario Kart and Ciri wasn&#39;t fast enough to stop me from opening it and popping it in the Wii. :)) I had to download some updates for the Wii, but after about 5 minutes I was behind the Wiimote steering wheel. I had some trouble with the Wiimote&#39;s sensitivity in the past and I was afraid that using the steering wheel would drive me to insanity, but after my first race on the wimpy 50cc series, I was sold. Amazingly responsive to my crazy driving, I zoomed through the tracks, earning my first Gold trophy. Nice. I wanted to start slow; run an easy track on the 50cc setting using auto drifting. I remember when the Revolution was announced, Nintendo&#39;s main goal was to bring gaming back to the masses. Veteran gamers will still be able to pick up a game and have a blast, but new gamers also face a shallow learning curve so they can have fun too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
