      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the resident stay at home parent, I am now in charge of many house duties.   Fixing the bed?   Me.   Cleaning? Always has been me.   Animal caretaker?   Me.   Cooking?   Me.   (I&#39;m so gonna get hell for that second one.)   I don&#39;t mind these responsibilities, as a matter of fact, I enjoy most of them.   Especially cooking.   I&#39;m not sure what it is, probably something to do with my geekyness, but I have so much fun creating meals from ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
