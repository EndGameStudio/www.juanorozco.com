      <description>&lt;p&gt;My sister, Tanya, has been drawing since she was a little kid.  Her and my brother are part of the reason why I didn&#39;t push myself to sketch and draw more when I was younger.  They are much more talented and gifted than I am with the pencil and brush.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was my brother&#39;s birthday a few days ago and I didn&#39;t get him anything. I have a good reason though! This year, I am trying to give everyone art - I need the practice :P. For Ciri, you can see the inspiration &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/theguamaso/3403674335/&#34;&gt;comes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://guamaso.com/2009/03/12/custom-challenge-coin-display-gift&#34;&gt;somewhat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://guamaso.com/2009/04/01/the-happy-plant&#34;&gt;easily&lt;/a&gt;. The last time I spent time with Bobby was probably about 6 or so years ago. The two of us have our little families and only visiting California twice in the past 5 years doesn&#39;t help either. It is understandable that inspiration for his gift was scarce. Until last Thursday night, that is.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
