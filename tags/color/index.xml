      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/adobe-ideas-1-0-for-iphone/id365441166?mt=8&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft&#34; src=&#34;http://juanthedesigner.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/mzl-reqegygc-320x480-75.jpg?resize=320%2C480&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; data-recalc-dims=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I use Adobe&#39;s Ideas app for quick notes  and ideas but also for some sketching.  I&#39;m not that great of a sketcher, so Ideas&#39; vector canvas makes me look a lot better.  In truth, I really use it a lot more for color inspiration. I like how it can create color palettes from photos on your phone (or iOS device).  If you&#39;re looking for an easy way to extract a color swatch for a project, use &lt;a href=&#34;http://itunes.apple.com/app/adobe-ideas/id364617858?mt=8&#34;&gt;Ideas - it&#39;s free!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Color Theory for Web Design and more.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, a few years back, when I first started designing web sites, I designed sites on what I thought looked good. After they were built, I realized that they looked like crap. They layout, the color, the content, and the usability. As I progressed, I learned more and more even though I didn&#39;t completely know or understand the theories and practices behind web design. Now, as my designs&#39; quality increase, I feel like in order to really fine tune everything, I need to know and understand every aspect of every theory involving design.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
