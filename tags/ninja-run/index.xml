      <description>&lt;p&gt;You can&#39;t say you&#39;re a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theninjachallenge.com/&#34;&gt;ninja until you complete this 5k obstacle/mud run&lt;/a&gt;.  I did two mud runs last year, this one and Rugged Maniac.  Both were difficult in their own way, but the Ninja run required WAY more upper body strength - of which I had NONE.  I had failed two of the obstacles because of my lack of ninja-ness.  To my credit, though, I was the only one (in our little group) that was able to scale the wall jump (my upper body strength has a huganticly slow casting speed and an even longer cool-down).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
