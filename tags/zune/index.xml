      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dramatic title, right? Well, it&#39;s just my opinion, but from the confirmed specs listed on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zune.net/en-us/press/2009/0526-zunehd.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Microsoft&#39;s release&lt;/a&gt; about the new Zune HD, I believe it is doomed to reside in the shadow of Apple&#39;s iPod alongside the rest of it&#39;s brethren. If things change between today and it&#39;s release then maybe the Zune HD has a chance. The people are eager to have choices in a Portable Media Player and therefore eager for the Zune brand to succeed. I know I am.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I bought my Zune, it was &lt;a href=&#34;http://guamaso.com/2008/07/06/the-precious-80-gig-zune&#34;&gt;after careful research and investigation&lt;/a&gt; that I decided to purchase one.   I knew it was a device with huge dreams of being the number one portable media player.   I knew that the path to that dream was long and dangerous.   But I bought one anyway.   I did it because I thought it had the potential and the drive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Precious: 80 Gig Zune</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Forgot to mention that with the great idea good ol&#39; George (W. Bush) concocted to stimulate the economy, I was able to finally purchase myself a PMD (portable media device). It took me a while to figure out which one I wanted the most. I started looking at what was out there and I know that I wanted a large hard drive to store all my music rather then loading just a small portion of it.   I have about 30 gigs of music as it is so I wanted at least a 40 gig drive, but I would prefer 60 to 80.   Of all the features, the hard drive is all I really cared about.   I would be happy with a small black and white screen and a huge hard drive.   But since they don&#39;t make anything like that I was stuck trying to figure out the best player for the money.   It came down to the IPod and the Zune.   I really liked the Creative Labs Zen, but it was too expensive and the hard drive was too small.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>For my Zune 80, Father’s Day?</title>
