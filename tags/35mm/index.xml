      <description>&lt;p&gt;My parents bought a Chinon SLR camera a loooong time ago.   I kinda sorta kept it and taught myself how to use it.   When I left for Germany, I found out, after not using it for years, that the lens was broken.   The aperture blades are stuck completely open.   I wanted to have a nice camera but couldn&#39;t afford what I really wanted: the Canon Rebel.   I also didn&#39;t like the overall quality from digital prints.   Prints made from 35mm film have a different feel to them, so I decided I wanted another film camera.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
