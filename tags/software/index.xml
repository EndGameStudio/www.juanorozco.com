      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I bought my Zune, it was &lt;a href=&#34;http://guamaso.com/2008/07/06/the-precious-80-gig-zune&#34;&gt;after careful research and investigation&lt;/a&gt; that I decided to purchase one.   I knew it was a device with huge dreams of being the number one portable media player.   I knew that the path to that dream was long and dangerous.   But I bought one anyway.   I did it because I thought it had the potential and the drive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Sketchup is great, but hard for me to get used to with my Autodesk background. Photoshop Elements is handy, but lacks some of the big tools found only in the full version of Photoshop. GIMP is pretty cool too, but it runs really slow on Windows (at least on mine it does), and I don&#39;t want to shut down and boot into Linux just so it runs faster. My point is there&#39;s pros and cons to everything in life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
