      <description>&lt;p&gt;January 1st 5k. I hit the new year running... literally. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.commitmentday.com/&#34;&gt;Commitment Day run was number one&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://juanthedesigner.wordpress.com/category/events/5k-events/&#34;&gt;six committed 5k&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; for this year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Run/walked the 5 kilos in about 36:39.9 minutes (I started the timer late, but ended it late as well.) This run was great. It was a beautiful run through downtown (I love the rain) and it really set the tone for me. Five kilometers isn&#39;t a big deal, really. But the commitment of actually going out of my comfort zone and doing them is the important part. Most of the remaining six runs will be mud/obstacle runs - these tend to be funner and more exciting. ðŸ™‚&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Entering the Rugged Maniac is one of the craziest things Iâ€™ve ever done.Â  I have never pushed myself so hard for so long under this amount of soreness and pain. In hindsight, I donâ€™t think I pushed myself that hard but the race was something I never thought Iâ€™d ever do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
