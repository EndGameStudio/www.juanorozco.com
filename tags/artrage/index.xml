      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been playing around with Art Rage lately.   I hear eyes are the hardest part to draw, so I started with those. Not too bad... still have a way to go, but still not bad at all.   I mean, for me anyway.   A friend from work let me borrow a book on drawing manga, it&#39;s been pretty helpful.   I think I am actually pretty good at drawing, I just need to learn the techniques.   The book really helps me with that.   I think I am going to shift over to inanimate objects for a bit, just so I don&#39;t get bored.   I also, want to come back to eyes later with a fresh mind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Sketchup is great, but hard for me to get used to with my Autodesk background. Photoshop Elements is handy, but lacks some of the big tools found only in the full version of Photoshop. GIMP is pretty cool too, but it runs really slow on Windows (at least on mine it does), and I don&#39;t want to shut down and boot into Linux just so it runs faster. My point is there&#39;s pros and cons to everything in life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
