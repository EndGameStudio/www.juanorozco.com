      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been playing around with Art Rage lately.   I hear eyes are the hardest part to draw, so I started with those. Not too bad... still have a way to go, but still not bad at all.   I mean, for me anyway.   A friend from work let me borrow a book on drawing manga, it&#39;s been pretty helpful.   I think I am actually pretty good at drawing, I just need to learn the techniques.   The book really helps me with that.   I think I am going to shift over to inanimate objects for a bit, just so I don&#39;t get bored.   I also, want to come back to eyes later with a fresh mind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
