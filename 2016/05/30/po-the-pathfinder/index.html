<p>I owned a VW Golf while we lived in Germany. I loved that car. It was simple. No crazy gadgets. No power steering. No air conditioning. No fuel injection. No power brakes. <strong>Just car.</strong></p>

<p>Today, back in the colonies, we are lucky to have added a baby to the family. This meant, though, that we were about to outgrow our 2000 Honda CR-V.</p>
<p>The search for a new car was on. We knew right away what type of car we needed; fuel efficient vehicle with third row seating. We narrowed it down to three contestants:</p>
<ul>
<li>2016 Honda Pilot</li>
<li>2013+ Volvo XC90</li>
<li>2013+ Nissan Pathfinder</li>
</ul>
<p>We loved the Pilot. I preferred the boxy styling of the pre 2013 models while the newst 2016 model had some impressive safety features. Unfortunately, the older generation had pretty bad <a href="http://safety.trw.com/whats-a-small-overlap-frontal-crash-test/1007/">small-overlap crash</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/8SPBd108Sfc?t=33">results</a>.
