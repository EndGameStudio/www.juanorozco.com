And that's ok because you love the crap outta them anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, when I test drove the Pathfinder for the first time, there was this familiarity.

Po the Pathfinder and I understood each other; we were kindred spirits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kids gave him his name. Named after Po from Kung Fu Panda, they thought it appropriate because of how much larger the Pathfinder is compared to the last family car, the Honda CR-V. Other than Nissan being a Japanese company while Po is technically Chinese, the name kinda fits. Po the Panda becomes the Dragon Warrior and learns so much about himself, much like myself and the Pathfinder brand. It actually works out as a name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, Po the Pathfinder is the newest member of the family transport. We're glad to have him. He's a fun car to drive.

<p>I owned a VW Golf while we lived in Germany. I loved that car. It was simple. No crazy gadgets. No power steering. No air conditioning. No fuel injection. No power brakes. <strong>Just car.</strong></p>
<p>I loved that car, alas, it didn't make sense to bring it back to the states with us. Unfortunately, people rarely buy those old cars so we had to junk it. My heart broke into a million pieces that day.</p>
<p>Today, back in the colonies, we are lucky to have added a baby to the family. This meant, though, that we were about to outgrow our 2000 Honda CR-V.</p>
<p>The search for a new car was on. We knew right away what type of car we needed; fuel efficient vehicle with third row seating. We narrowed it down to three contestants:</p>
<ul>
<li>2016 Honda Pilot</li>
<li>2013+ Volvo XC90</li>
<li>2013+ Nissan Pathfinder</li>
</ul>
<p>We loved the Pilot. I preferred the boxy styling of the pre 2013 models while the newst 2016 model had some impressive safety features. Unfortunately, the older generation had pretty bad <a href="http://safety.trw.com/whats-a-small-overlap-frontal-crash-test/1007/">small-overlap crash</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/8SPBd108Sfc?t=33">results</a>.
