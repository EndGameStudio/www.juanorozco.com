<p>I do have to admit that cooking over a stove is an animal, but baking is a true beast!   Some would say the stove is a bit more difficult, but I say the oven is unforgiving.</p>
<p>I am starting with easy recipes.   A couple of weeks ago I tried some cookies by using a cake mix.   The recipe was on the box and I kick myself for not copying it down.   The cookies turned out great, a little overcooked - which is why I said &quot;unforgiving&quot; - but still yummy.   I could have used the recipe today, but since I didn't keep it, I had to result to the internet.</p>
<p>I found a recipe that sounded about right and went to work.   First I made a batch without <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">mushrooms</span> marshmallows since Ciri doesn't care for them. Side note: I must have some sort of dyslexia because everytime I want to say marshmallows, I say mushrooms instead.   It also seems to extend into my typing.   Not good.</p>
<p>Anyway, so the first batch came out a bit cakey; very soft.   I followed the recipe, but for some reason the cookies came out like cookie-shaped cake.   Although, after they had time to cool down, they did harden a bit.</p>
<p>My second batch included the marshmallows.   This is where I say the oven is unforgiving.   The mallows overcooked, lost too much moisture and became rock hard.   I tried to cook them longer so that they would come out like cookies and not cake.</p>
<p>Afterward, I met with my personal chef trainer - the wife.   She advised me that I should try heavy cream instead of milk and maybe use two eggs instead of one.   I made them for her so we could have a <a href="http://www.bjsrestaurants.com/desserts.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pizookie</a> for desert tonight and I am just glad they were edible.</p>
<p>My next baking attempt will be homemade granola.   Stay tuned for that disaster.   *snicker*   I need to give myself more credit.   Oy.</p>
<p>Here's the recipe, be warned: they may come out like cake-ookies.   I got it from Cooks dot com.</p>
<p>1 pkg. semi-sweet chocolate chips</p>
<p>1 stick butter, softened</p>
<p>1/2 c. walnuts or pecans</p>
<p>1/2 c. oatmeal</p>
<p>1 egg</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I had some cookies yesterday from this batch and they were exceptional.   I take everything bad back about this recipe- it doesn't need to be changed.   I do remember having to cook them a little longer though.   Marshmallows are still a No-go.</p>
