<p>Baking is the closest I will probably ever get to a laboratory science and I am ok with that. I love the sciences and I like laboratory science but can you eat HCl and live? Unless you have Wolverine's healing factor, I highly doubt it.</p>
<p>Baking is a one hell of a science. An unforgiving, finicky, and <em>extremely</em> rewarding science. Measurements often need to be precise. Heat must be applied with attention. Patience and attention to detail are key. Experimentation is <strong>highly</strong> encouraged.</p>
<p>It's also tasty.</p>
<h2>Today's Experiment {#todaysexperiment}</h2>
<p>The kids and I were watching <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/M14">one of the Pokemon movies</a> that dropped on Netflix a while back. In it was the Pokemon, Victini, swiping and munching on some of Ash and team's macarons. There's a lot of good values to get from the Pokemon movies. Friendship, teamwork, etc. What do my kids get from it? <em>Macarons are awesome.</em></p>
<p>The kids have been asking for macarons ever since. Today, I finally delivered on their desires.</p>
<h2>Macaroons or Macarons? {#macaroonsormacarons}</h2>
<p>In the movie, the characters pronounce them &quot;Mack-ah-rhons&quot;. I always thought they were &quot;mack-ah-roons&quot;. Apparently both are correct... sort of. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaroon">Macaroons</a> usually include coconut and are more almond based.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaroon#French">Macarons</a>, or French Macarons, are more of a meringue. They still have almond flour/meal but don't include coconut.</p>
<p>Based on the visuals in the movie, it seems like our target objective, then, is the <em>French Macaron</em>.</p>
<h2>To the laboratory! {#tothelaboratory}</h2>
<p>Have you ever had eggs in your coffee? No? It's like coffee flavored custard - and AMAZING. But that's a recipe for another day. The convenient part is that I had some left over egg whites ready for meringue-ing.</p>
<p>There are lots of tips and tricks and other voodoo for making sure you get the best macarons. When I told the kids I would make them their very own macarons, I had ZERO idea that these were &quot;the hardest cookies to make&quot; in all of Bakelandia. I was trolling baking websites when I found out how deep in pro french pâtissier territory I was.</p>
<p>Doing something new means I was already in research mode. Finding out I was doing something <em>very</em> difficult just means I do <em>more</em> research. Before I actually made it to the kitchen, I compiled my notes and made sure I was at least semi-comfortable with the entire process.</p>
<p>Keeping track of these notes or just having a good capturing process is directly related to success.</p>
<h2>My Process {#myprocess}</h2>
<p>I like to have my ingredients prepared before I start. I ground up the sugar, prepped all my tools, and made sure the egg whites were room temperature - that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>My meringue-fu is non existent so I wasn't sure what the textures and consistencies of any of the recipe's steps should be. But that is what this is all about, learning and developing the skills!</p>
<p>Pro tip number two: Document (either mentally or on paper) the consistencies and textures at every step. Take photos. Make notes. This will help discover possible improvement opportunities.</p>
<p>My egg whites were clumpy and not very poofy. I probably mixed them too much. Once I added the sugar and cream of tartar, they smoothed out nicely, though.</p>
<h2>The final product {#thefinalproduct}</h2>
<p><img src="/content/images/2014/Jul/2014-07-25-18-13-19.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>My first batch came out pretty good. Although most of them cracked at the top, I still call this a win; they were edible.</p>
<p>Most of my problems can be traced to my folding technique. I was fairly rough with the mixture and after I saw most of the macarons cracking, I looked up why. This is mostly a result of over or under mixing the dry ingredients with the egg whites.</p>
<p>Doing an &quot;after action review&quot; helped highlight changes in my process. Compiling research notes and process notes into a central set helps this final process.</p>
<h2>Do it again {#doitagain}</h2>
<p>My next batch will be better. But I can't tackle every problem at once. I'll focus on the cracking. Although I wasn't happy with the texture of the macaron, the shell cracking is totally unacceptable. My next batch will probably focus more on my folding technique rather than the recipe. Once I get the cracking down, I'll tackle the texture. Who knows, maybe fixing one problem will fix the other.</p>
<p>The point is, don't feel discouraged when something doesn't come out perfect. As long as learning occured, the attempt was <em>not a failure</em>. Just get back in there and try again. Eating the result is just as fun as <em>making</em> the result after all.</p>
