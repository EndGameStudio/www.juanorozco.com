- **Senior Front End Engineer at Shortcut Software**: We make project management software that brings you joy. I’ve been at Shortcut for a couple years now and in that time I’ve helped build some cool things like Threaded Comments, Custom Fields, and our document tool, Docs. Currently, working on our Docs tool - helping to make it better and more helpful.
- **Photography**: I try to make time for photography whenever I can. Although, right now, I’m trying to get my Part 107 license so I have more freedom in flying my drone. There’s been so many places where I thought about certain shots but they’re not possible without my license.
- **Nomadic but parked**: We're currently parked in Northern California hiding in the old tall trees.
