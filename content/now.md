- **Staff Frontend Engineer**: Although [laid off earlier this year](/blog/2023/free-agent/), I have landed a new role at Act Blue where I'll help build out their Design System!
- I've been volunteering at the local group that cares for one of our two lighthouses. I've been updating [the website](https://www.saintgeorgereeflight.org/) and helping them spread the word about their preservation efforts.
