- **Staff Frontend Engineer**: For over a year now, I've been working on a multi-brand expression design system, helping our teams create new features faster.
- I started coaching youth robotics teams in 2024. We started with three roookie teams. One of my teams is headed to state championships and another is still running meets but is currently 4th in their league and 18th in the state! So proud of all my teams and everything they have learned.
