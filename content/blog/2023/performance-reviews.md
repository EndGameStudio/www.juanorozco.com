Over the last, say, five years of my career, I have begun to question the value of yearly reviews in an organization *a lot*. To be clear, I'm not questioning the value of good feedback - although difficult to do right, good feedback is _invaluable_ for personal growth.

_Yearly_ reviews have been fairly static in my different experiences. At the end of the year, we set aside some time to collect our thoughts on leaders, peers, and ourselves in the context of the last year. Then, that feedback is collected into the mysterious machine that is management and HR. At some point, the manager meets with the direct report on their progress over the year and discuss.

The common pattern I've noticed through my experiences is that feedback is not transparent, it is not consistent, and it is not actionable.

## Transparency allows process to be held accountable

In rare cases, reviews have felt like an facade; a ritual, that allows leadership to quickly and efficiently assess who gets a raise so they can quickly start thinking about the fiscal implications. In these cases, feedback is simply a -1, 0, or +1 rating and any useful nuance in the actual feedback is lost. A simple rating is not transparent and not helpful to direct reports. It is only useful to upper management and HR.

## Consistency is kindness

In college, my English 101 professor told me I was doing great and I should have skipped the course and went to 102. I decided to continue refreshing the basics and stuck with it for the full semester. Then, when I started in 102, my new professor told me I should probably retake 102 because I was lacking in some skills. If both statements were true, that would have to mean that my first professor taught me poorly and I got worse without anyone noticing! Or perhaps one of those statements were derived from some subjective review. 

This phenomenon followed me in my career. One manager said I was great, that I should "keep doing what I was doing". Then, when I found myself with another manager, my next review was less than stellar. I had some opportunities here and there. Still great but, basically performing at the standard versus my performing above the standard the year before. Had I gotten worse? Or were one (or both!) of the reviews subjective? 

This is my life. I'm giving you *years* of it. I think it is fair to ask for a little higher quality process in how I am assessed in my career and in my contributions.

On the other hand, we are humans being reviewed by humans. It *is* subjective! There is a balance. Using [specific language without emotion](https://lattice.com/library/how-to-write-more-effective-performance-review-comments) when providing feedback is a big part. This is difficult to do and requires practice, which brings me to a bonus side point.

### Use Anniversaries as a cadence

I was inspired to write this after reading Jacob Kaplan-Moss' article on [the timing of performance reviews](https://jacobian.org/2022/oct/25/against-performance-seasons/), where Jacob pushes for the idea of having performance reviews based on anniversary versus a fiscal calendar. This most definitely comes with its own challenges (when do raises happen? how do other groups handle the reviews, like HR or upper management?) but it solves a lot of problems where it matters: the people that do the actual thing. Writing feedback is a _consistent_ part of the job, it is part of the culture. It will naturally flex and build muscles that yearly reviews only use once a year.

## Actionable feedback is the point

Reviews are often tied to raises, so it feels like the overall ritual is _about_ the raise and less so about growth. In my experience, actionable feedback is uncommon and *actual* plans for growth are _rare_. If a manager knows what a direct report should be doing, try to figure out what is blocking the direct report from actually doing it. Then help them build a plan to start doing it and sustain the doing of the it. That might be heavy handed but I argue that it provides the most value for the time given to reviews; it provides the most return on an employee over their time in that company.

## Conclusion

Performance reviews should result in plans for growth - that's the *goal*. We can acheive this by focusing more on a transparent process and providing more actual feedback from peers and managers. That transparency will result in more trust of the process. Further trust is built by having a process that is balanced well between the subjective people that are part of the system and the objective needs of the company. This clarity further enhances transparency into the process - we know and understand what parts are subjective and how we mitigate their effects. Lastly, we strive to provide a things that people can actually *do*. We don't want people to *be* something... we want them to *do* something. Celebrate who they are now and encourage them to act towards the needs of their teams and goals.
