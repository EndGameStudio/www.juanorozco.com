Memorial day is important to us. We don't grill hot dogs or go camping - no judgement to those that do, though, coordinated time off with work and school is hard to come by, I get it. Because I normally work remotely and our kids are homeschooled, though, we are lucky enough to explore different ways of seeing the world.

Ciri, an Army Veteran, for this year's Memorial day encouraged us to write and present a short essay on a service member that was killed in action or missing in action. Last year, we were at Boo Castle Park, or what we call Dungeons and Dragons park, in Carbondale Illinois. We were in the middle of a family D&D campaign and I worked in an encounter where a party, much like our kids' party who died defending their land, reached out from the astral plane to lend them their power to defeat a dragon. The kids heard the story of, basically, the Unknown Soldier.

This year, Ciri's plan was to pull us back to our little multiverse, find and discuss a hero from our past.

I expected this task would be easy considering the number of wars in our recorded history. I didn't expect the sheer breadth of history we record over our service members. To be clear, I knew we kept records but, holy moly, there's a LOT. And I learned that our government revisits that history periodically for accuracy. What was supposed to be a simple essay turned into a great appreciation for all the people the have come before and the people dedicated to keeping their memories alive.

I searched through the Medal of Honor list and found there was so many to pick from... so many heroic people. I narrowed my search to Medal of Honor recipients to people of color. Personally, I'm not sure when the last time I heard of a Mexican Medal of Honor recipient so I thought I'd focus my search a bit. I found Joe Gandara, who's entry was not as detailed as some other recipients but who's actions were equally heroic. Here's my short essay:
