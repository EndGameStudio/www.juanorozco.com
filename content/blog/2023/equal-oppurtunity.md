I want to tell you a story about a person I knew. I hope that it serves as some insights into the lives of minorities. Take what you want from it, nothing, everything, whatever you wish. Just, hear me out to the end, though.

A young child in poor neighborhood, his dad working long hours far away while his mother made sure he learned to read, tie his shoes, and speak respectfully - especailly to his elders. Between his mom and dad, they instilled in him a thirst for better. To work for tomorrow because today is done. As a young child, he only spoke Spanish but because of his mom's help, he quickly learned English. Yet, in school, he was part of the bilingual classes. The education system classified him as needing remedial training before he could learn solely in English. He disagreed, he had learned that being different held him back. He need to be like the other english speaking kids. So, at the start of Second grade, he lied to his teachers, explaining that his mom said it was OK to be in the full english program.

He saw the smart kids acting a certain way - basically, not like his family. His mom wanted him to be smart; to be better then they were. He assumed that meant being like the other kids. But he didn't fit in as is. Something about him was just so different that no matter how much he tried to be like them, he _wasn't_ them.

He grew up, shunning his culture. Shunning the country that his parents called home. That culture was not for him because it wasn't forward thinking, it wasn't good enough for the smart people, for the people building the future. He learned to code switch, to turn himself into something he wasn't.

It worked. He received good grades, never got into trouble, and got jobs working in technology. He's married, has kids, pays his taxes, and works hard.

But he's incredibly hurt because what he has and what he is, was given to him through his lies. He pretended to be like them, but he never was. He knew, that the only way to succeed was to walk differently and talk differently.

Equal oppurtunity laws give braver people than him a chance. These couragous people can bring their culture to new places, can lend their ways of thinking to the greater population and make everyone more successful.

The smart kids don't need these laws to succeed. We're all human and our decisions, no matter how altruistic or seemingly objective, are inately subjective. Look around you and see how many people are code switching.
