# Starlink and Changes

Starlink, for some customers, has recently changed the direction of the dish from North to West and it causing some strife after people spent money clearing their view of the North, sometimes thousands, only to have to now clear their western view.

Starlink provides great value for many people across the globe. Where I currently live, we can't get reliable internet for less than the monthly price of Starlink's Residential service, $110 per month. Cellular companies that offer home internet only offer business plans for our address, probably because our address is a campground, and even then, these plans include data caps in the low hundreds of Gigabytes.

Our campground has promised Spectrum Wifi in the next year and, my understanding, is that each node is a fiber optic connected device which sounds reliable and fast. But its not here yet.

So, Starlink keeps the lights on in my home. I can do my job, get paid, and watch the next episode of Last of Us, although maybe not in 4K like I would prefer just to conserve on my 1 TB datacap. Still, it just worksâ„¢ and for $110 per month, I'm not complaining.

Except that I am going to complain. There have been significant changes over the last 12 months to how our service works and bills. For each change, we need to consider the value against the cost. For $110 per month, I get about 112 megabits per second down, 19.7 megabits/second up, and about 55 millisecond latency. That alone is expensive unless we also consider the competition. I have payed up to $200/month for cellular data just to do zoom calls and other work activities - not for streaming TV shows and movies, though. For this, I would connect my phone via HDMI to my TV to leverage the free streaming of my phone's plan. That's a lot of work! $110 is great value to me!

Actually, a year ago it was $100. Still, $110 is still valuable.

Portability was added last year for free but then was turned into a paid feature. If I start moving in the RV again, the price will go up $25 per month. This is hard to tell since this Portability feature is best available, meaning speeds are not guaranteed. Cellular was notoriously unreliable for us as we travelled, with latency and speeds variying by the minute. Provided Portability is simply _more_ reliable than, yea, still worth it.

New plans rolled out as well. Most notable for us is the RV plan. Same price but basically always in Portability mode. The nice thing for us is that we get priority service at our home address. The value with this plan would be based on how reliable it is throughout the day. I prefer consistent low latency and would sacrifice speeds down to ye olden days of DSL, 5 Mb down and 1Mb up.

New dishes came out, the high performance larger surface dish and the fixed dish for mobility. Incredibly expensive options that don't provide us with more value. The normal dish works fine for us, no need to spend more for same.

Then, the moment we all feared and knew was coming. Data caps. Residential plans now have a data cap of 1 TB per month. Before this change, we were streaming 4K TV and, quite honestly, used Starlink like a regular landline option. My IoT devices used as much bandwidth as they wanted. Like, my Wyze cams were basically always on and sending clips to the cloud. This change hurt the most but I also understand the reasoning. We're sharing a limited resource that isn't to full capacity but has grown in demand a lot over the years. And, 1 TB is still very usable, we just need to be more mindful. Still valuable but we're starting to see the the scales balance a bit more.

This last week, I noticed our service was dropping out more than it used to. To the North, we have some tall Redwoods that we can't do anything about. We've dealt with the obstructed service and its been fine. I did some basic troubleshooting, like restarting the system and checking for damage. When I went to check the dish, I realized it was pointing West instead of North. West has double the trees and much higher.

Redwoods are mostly protected and, even the ones that are not protected, I refuse to cut down. As a side note, the remaining number of redwoods is only 20% of their original count. Old growth is even less.
