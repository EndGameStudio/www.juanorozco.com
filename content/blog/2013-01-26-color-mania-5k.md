Not to be confused with [Color Run][1], Color Mania is hosting their own color run in April.  Ciri and I are signed up and we will be bringing the kids.

This should be number two of my [committed][2] [six 5Ks this year][3].  It depends on if/when the [WordPress 5k][4] will be.

Info:

  * Run/walk from what read.
  * You get color thrown at you. 😀
