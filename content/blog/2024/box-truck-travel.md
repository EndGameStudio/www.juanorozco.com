Last October, I reserved a box truck, packed our storage unit in the back, and drove 3750 miles from Apex, North Carolina to Del Norte County in Northern California. By myself. I optimized my trip for speed and cost effectiveness - I needed to get home quickly and not spend too much money doing so. I learned a lot about myself, about traveling, and about moving in general. 2023 was not an easy year for me personally so I appreciated the time to myself and the time to think.

October is a beautiful time in North Carolina. The leaves are full into their change, the humidity, for the most part, has broken into cooler dryer temperatures. The leftover downpours fill the air with that wonderful smell of fresh rain. It was wonderful visiting last year. The drive out of NC, through Tennesee, Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, Utah, Arizona, and, finally, all the way up California, well, it was long.

We decided that California is home again and to dot the last T and cross the last I, I had to reserve a box truck, load it up with our storage unit and move it literally coast to coast on my own in less than ten days.

## Planning

Getting your goods moved across the country can be done in many ways.

## The moving method

- Load some "pods" and have them professionaly transported
- Rent and load some space in a transport truck
- Rent a box truck and drive it yourself

The cheapest option for our coast to coast move would have been renting some space on a transport truck and, if we could have gone that route, we would have. Getting the truck to reach our storage unit in California was not possible due to our sort of remote nature. The moving pods suffered from the same problem, we'd have to drive to Oakland and then drive it back up north ourselves. To further complicate things, we were on one side of the country and our storage unit was on the other side - who would physically move the contents of the storage unit? Us? Ok, that means plane tickets.

After pricing everything out, it just made sense to take a box truck cross country.

Sourcing a box truck was mildly frustrating but I'm really happy with how it all worked out. The Penske truck I received was clean and reliable. I did have a stability control light turn on but more on that later. The real work was finding a good deal. UHaul trucks were oddly overpriced compared to Penske and Budget. Even with deals I found, they were still more expensive and, maybe this is just a numbers game, but U-haul had the most horror stories of all box truck rentals. Since I would be on my own and because they were, generally, $1000 over their competitors, I ended on Penske.

Chances are you have access to some pretty good deals, through your employer, a credit card, or a perk from your bank. Ciri was able to use her veteran benefit to get us a sweet discount.

Pro tip: when renting the truck, you can also borrow some moving items like blankets and a hand truck. I ended up not really using the hand truck. Partly because I had a wagon in storage but also because most of our items were simply boxes. The blankets, though... get more than you need. Defintiely splurge a bit on towels.

### Getting to NC

This is where I got lucky. I ended having to travel to the east coast for work. I ended up heading to RDU as my return flight which saved me a few hundred dollars.

### Logistics planning

I wanted to have a high level plan on of my days.

- Where would I sleep?
- Where would I work?
- What will I eat?
- How long could I safely drive each day?

Bigger questions I needed to answer were:

- How was I going to pick up the truck?
- How was I going to get from the airport to hotel?
- How was I going to move items? By myself? Yikes!

### The route home

Based on some answers earlier, I started to route my drive. I realized that super fine planning was a waste of time. On one day, I routed my path with some assumptions. The next day, when I went to review my plan, I realized my assumptions were off and changed my route. In the end, I instead planned on milestones. I needed to be in St Louis by Sunday night. I actually made it to Limon Colorado by Sunday evening. Since I stopped often to stretch and walk, as the vague parts became clearer, I was better able to plan ahead. Specifically, I figured out where I would sleep and where I would eat.
