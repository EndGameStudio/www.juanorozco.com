This is what I love about design, it fixes problems you didn't realize you had until something comes along that makes you say, "Well, yea... why wasn't it done that way before?" &nbsp;The one thing I would say about this is the handle needs some sort of tactile feedback to let the user know the stop has popped out. &nbsp;It lets the user know how to retract the stop, but it needs to be tactile as well. &nbsp;Other than that, love it.
