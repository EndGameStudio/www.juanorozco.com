I'm convincing Ciri that we should build our future home out of shipping containers. She's surprisingly receptive to the idea. So much so, that she went out and researched container homes on her own. She came back with something called [The Quik House.][1] It's really cool. But the coolest thing came when we went to watch Tron. Sam Flynn's pad? Quik House. If it's good enough for the son of Flynn, it's good enough for this family!
