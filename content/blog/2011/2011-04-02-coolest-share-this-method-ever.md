I have two thoughts on this really cool sharing method. First, it's pretty, intuitive and fun. Yea, it's actually so cool, it's fun!

Second, where's the JQuery plugin?

As far as using it, it does need more services. Right now it's only Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and Instapaper. Half of those I don't use.  Still, it's very very cool. [Download it here.][2]
