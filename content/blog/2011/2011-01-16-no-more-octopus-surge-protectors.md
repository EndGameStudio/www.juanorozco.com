title: No more octopus surge protectors

[<img class="aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2010/12/21/rotating_plug3.jpg?resize=580%2C451" alt="" width="580" height="451" data-recalc-dims="1" />][1]I really don't like those stringy surge protectors that work well with wall blisters.  They're big, awkward, and ugly.  This guy isn't much better, but it seems like it will hide easier since the length is adjustable.  The only thing, and this can be an issue, those little plugs look like toys. If I know kids, and I like to think I do with four little feet running around my house, I can see these things either getting full of kid goo or ending up in some toy box for eternity.
