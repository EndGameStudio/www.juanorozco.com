When I was a kid, I remember gimicks like this were rampant.  Maybe the products have continued since then and I haven't paid attention, but the one thing I remember is how unsuccessful they always were.  The reward of playing outside, the motivation as well, is fun.  Good ol' Sandlot kind of fun.  Watches aren't going to encourage this behavior... especially at a premium.  As a nerd, I think these watches are awesome, but as a parent I'm like, "Really?"  Cool idea, but it ain't gonna happen.
