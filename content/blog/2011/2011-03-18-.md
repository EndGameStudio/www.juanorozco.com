SquareEnix released some of the best songs in gaming, i.e. One Winged Angel and Frogs Theme song.  The best part of all this beautiful music is the fan created stuff.  OCRemix is one of my favorite places to visit for remixes and reimagined gaming music.

When OC Remix released its Final Fantasy IV arrangement way back when, I immediately wanted the fan created music included into my Final Fantasy IV experience. Rather than having to redo all the original music in the ported version for updated hardware, why not include the OC Remix music? Fine, do both! Like different audio tracks on a DVD.

Don't stop with FF4, re-release Chrono Trigger as an app version (wiiware, Xbox live, iOS, etc.) with the original Square track and an optional (unlockable?) OCRemix track.  Square wouldn't need to pay the artists much, if at all.  I think it's safe to assume that most of them would just be happy to know their rendition is just being included in the game.
