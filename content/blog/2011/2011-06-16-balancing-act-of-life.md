I started a new position with a small software development company in Garner.  Well, near Garner.  Much closer to home -  my drive time has been cut down from 50 minutes to 15.  That's pretty exciting for me although the driver never bothered me, it is pretty nice being home so quickly.  As a matter of fact, that was one of the selling points the recruiter kept giving me.  It's less of a drive, you'll be at home more, etc. etc. etc.

I started this past Monday.  On my second day, I'm talking to a fellow lead developer and he started talking about how we all usually stay until 7, 8, 9... sometimes until midnight.  My jaw dropped.  I'm a family oriented Dad, I like being home with the kids and wife.  I like giving them their baths and feeding them dinner on nights that Ciri has to work her overnight shifts.  I believe that any company that continuously expects an employee of any rank to stay late on a regular basis is not a very good employer.
