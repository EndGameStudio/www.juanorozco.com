I've heard and seen these popular shoes all my life. I need to explain that I don't care about clothing.  I'm not into the designer names or the vintage crap.  I shop at Target. Cheap and comfortable.  My little brother got a new pair for his birthday last month and Ciri bought the Target brand version a while back.  I've asked people with them if they're comfortable and durable.  To my surprise, these flimsy looking shoes are very durable and fairly comfortable.

Old Shoes, they be talkin'.

I bought my shoes when we were in Germany over 5 years ago.  Ciri and I were training to run the Paris marathon and I knew that I needed some good shoes. A pair that were designed for my ugly flat feet and some hardcore training.  Although, we never completed training or made it to the marathon, I at least got a good pair of shoes out of the experience.

Alas, the shoes' tread is running thin.  The heel is beginning to split - it looks like some sort of muppet reject from the back.  So when we were at Target buying some much needed baby clothes, I decided it was time to buy some new pair of shoes.  Normally, I just buy the basic pro spirit brand walking/running shoes but today, tax refund money in hand, I thought it was time to splurge a bit on some good shoes.
