Years ago... actually it's been about a decade now... photo printing at home was still gaining momentum.  Ink jet printer quality was not near as good as Shutterfly or Snapfish and cost almost as much.  Today these technologies have improved, but I argue that actual print services still create the best work. On the other hand, some of the prints I make are for for less than archive quality, but I still want to stay away from ink jet. Enter Dye Sublimation printers.
