title: What a failing hard drive sounds like.

I'm emptying a USB drive as I type this so I can back up the bad drive. I thought it would be fun to post the nasty sound it was making in the mean time. Â This is the first hard drive to ever fail on me - it's also not one of the oldest HD's I have either. Scary.
