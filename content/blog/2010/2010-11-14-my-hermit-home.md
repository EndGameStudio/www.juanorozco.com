Since we became home owners, one of my dreams has been to build a small shed in the back that acts as a small workspace / quiet observation area.  As I started researching the idea, I found lots of ideas using different mediums.  The ones that really stand out are the container homes.  There are some beautiful living spaces designed by some real imaginative architects.

Not once did I think to see how much a shipping container actually costs. For $1600, my dream is more attainable than I first thought.
