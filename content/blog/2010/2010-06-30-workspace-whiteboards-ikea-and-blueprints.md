There are two things I love about this workspace.  First, the whiteboard is an awesome idea.  A raw surface for which to scribble thoughts and ideas - beautiful. Love it.  Second, blueprints. I looooveee me some technical drawings. If I could, I would pin some to the ceiling in our studio... but, alas, I doubt the wife would approve.
