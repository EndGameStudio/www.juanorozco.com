Having worked at Target before, I'm not surprised by this. They're one of the few companies that have embraced good design or just "design" in general. Â It's also great to see how designers can change the way companies do business and even how people live their lives. Computers and phones are one thing and I think those objects draw us into the world of design, but the real meat of what needs good design isn't chairs or washers or clocks - it's these objects, commonly used everyday things.
