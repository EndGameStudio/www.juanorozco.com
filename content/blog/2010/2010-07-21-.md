It's true. At least, I think it is.  I read that the biggest factor in the decline of Drive-Ins was Daylight savings time. I think it was technology.  I can watch good TV at home or watch high resolution movies with 10 gajillion speakers in a comfy movie theater.  The drive in, on the other hand, was neither loud or convenient.  Driving around for a spot and hopefully your car was comfortable enough for the two hours of tinny speakers and low quality video.

Bat darn it if it wasn't a heck of a lot funner than the theater or sitting at home.  Open air, the night sky above you, snackbar in the distance with the bright light shing on your screen - almost like it was beckoning to lost ships in a dense fog.  Only, instead, it beckoned you to watch the screen with it's pre-show cartoons of Bugs and Daffy.  Good times, good times.

I guess the improvements in technology outweighed the fun and atmosphere of the 50's era movie theaters.  Wait a second. My phone plays videos and music located across the nation.  It can even use this new-fangled mail delivery system that uses 0 and 1's instead of paper.  Why can't we implement the technology back into the Drive ins?

HD Radio to the rescue.

HD Radio is capable of surround sound, although most stock vehicle audio sustems aren't designed for it - it is possible.
