Ironically, I didn’t always have this awe for my culture.  I used to hate my name and I hated where we lived even more. I explored the inner workings of Windows 3.X while the other kids played soccer in the streets. If you thought computers were bully magnets in the suburbs, imagine what the effect was on kids that grew up in lesser areas.

I find art inspired by Mexican culture, like music, movies, and paintings, and I feel proud and happy to be part of something so rich and delightful.

But as creative's, we pull most of our inspiration from our environment.  Although I learned that being different isn’t a bad thing, I also learned that being the similar is a good thing.

This isn’t just about who we are or where we came from – it is also about what we love and enjoy.  I am intrigued with Japanese and Irish cultures.  The warriors and the battles, the people and the cultures, it all fascinates me.  Even though I have learned that my culture is important, I still balance who I am and what I am inspired by.

As creative's we draw inspiration from our environment, but every once and a while, it’s nice to be the inspiration for your own work.
