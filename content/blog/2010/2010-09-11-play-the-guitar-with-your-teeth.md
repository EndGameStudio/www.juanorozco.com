Every so often I'll catch Jonas with a teething toy in his mouth and drool all over his shirt. I think he would love something like this.

I really enjoy finding all these wooden toys on Etsy.  You'd think that with all the plastics and die cast that wooden toys would be extinct.  Well, they may be endangered, but there are still a few gems out there.
