title: When we first moved in, we had one trashâ€¦
type: post

When we first moved in, we had one trash can that held all our trash. It was picked up every week. We started recycling (at the local recycling center) and composting (or a while, anyway) and we then needed it picked up every three weeks. Now, no composting, separate recycling container? Both bins get picked up every two to three weeks. Two things amaze me: 1) how much trash we make and 2) how much recycling augments the rate we fill the trash can.
