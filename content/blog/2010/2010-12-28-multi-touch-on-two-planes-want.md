My questions is, how is this not mass produced yet? It seems pretty doable, right? Maybe I'm just biased by the amount of want I have for it. It even picks up touch at the bend of the screen! Speaking of which, I like how they use the bend as a sort of dock, I can think of any other use for that part of the screen since it would distort the image. But, whatever, major coolness. Click through and watch the video. I'd say it only needs a little more power - there's a big lag at the video game bit.
