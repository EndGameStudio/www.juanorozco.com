Two years I have lived in an area that gets a few weeks of snow. It's not a lot, but enough to have some fun with.  Both years how I missed something to mold and handle snow - forcing it to take some shape that I could build and create with.  This snowblower looks like the lawn mower my Grandpa used to have for his smallish yard.  Don't be fooled, it actually takes in snow and turns it into building blocks.  Bring the family this winter, I'm making an ice hotel.
