Evernote is one of my favorite workflow tools.  It keeps me organized and it helps me capture ideas faster.

I found Egretlist through the Evernote Trunk. It had average reviews but what drew me in was it's ability to sync with Evernote.  My current To Do app only syncs with Toodledo or with it Outlook, neither of which I care to use.
