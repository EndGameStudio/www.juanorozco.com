The idea of living minimally has always intrigued me, but with a wife that doesn't share my... eccentricity, and two children under 3, conducting such an experiment is not within my scope.  Reading a blog about a student, on the other hand, is.  [UN v2.0][1]. The writer starts living in the structure he built at the beginning of September. I'm looking forward to reading about how he survives in such a small area.
