It's been a while since I visited Lego.com, or any Lego related website, for that matter.   I subscribe to Lego magazine and I will occasionally browse over to the Lego blogs via other blogs.

I'm not into building Legos like I was as a child, or even in High School (**Geek-cred**: I did a presentation in class with my Lego models as a visual aid) but that doesn't mean they don't have a special place in my heart.

I remember the days of Lego City and Octane and Space and the first years of the Technic line.   Now, there's Star Wars and Batman and Indiana Jones and anime inspired minifigs and so much more.   I can't wait for the day when I hand Izzy-monster her first <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/guamaso-20/detail/B000NO9GT4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blue bin</a>.   But that's neither here nor there.

Last week I got a holiday shopping catalog and it had all the new sets that the Lego-sphere has been going crazy with.   The Taj Mahal, for example, is the largest set (piece count) in Lego history and is especially popular with the Lego bloggers.

One item that got my attention was the <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/guamaso-20?_encoding=UTF8&node=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stormtrooper minifig key chain</a>.   Since I don't build anymore, I only read about Lego's for sentimental reasons.   When I saw the line of key chains, I thought they would be perfect for the retired Lego builder- dangling off a key chain as a reminder of the good ol' days where imagination and inspiration ran free.   Sigh.   Yup.   Simpler times....   Aaanyyway, don't get me goin' down that route...

What I'm trying to get at is that these little dudes are a sign of every geek's past and make a perfect "whenever" gift for either the retired Lego-ist, or the active builders.   It's a gift that really does say "I love my geek."   I will add this little guy to my wishlist in case anybody feels the need to say... well, you know.   If you want to support The Guamaso and want to pick up some keychains follow this <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/guamaso-20?_encoding=UTF8&node=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link to my Amazon Store</a>.
