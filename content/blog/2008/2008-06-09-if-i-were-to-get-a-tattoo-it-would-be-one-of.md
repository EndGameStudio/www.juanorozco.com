The Triforce of Courage... on my hand of course.   Ever since I read the comic book of Legend of Zelda when I was a kid, I wanted to possess the triforce of Courage.   The mark of the triforce signifies that the bearer was chosen to possess the Triforce of Courage.   The triforce of Courage has healing and protective properties; it is a mark of the Goddess Farore whose "rich soul" created life for the kingdom of Hyrule.

Anyway, now I am all growed up and on my own, I was thinking about the new tattoo fad.   I don't agree with tattoos, I'm pretty sure it's a sin to mark up your body like that.   But I really just don't like the way some of them look; skulls and dead people, yuck.   I don't think I would ever get a tattoo, but if i did it would totally be the simple design of three triangles: the Triforce of Courage.   I found a bunch of pictures of people that have various Triforce tattoos, but if you are a real Zelda fan, the only place the triforce should go is your hand... maybe your wrist.   Check out the pics I found to get an idea of what I am talking about.
