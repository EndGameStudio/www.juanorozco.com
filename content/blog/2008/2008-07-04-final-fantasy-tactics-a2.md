Square Enix released the next installment to the FF line: <a href="http://www.ebgames.com/Catalog/ProductDetails.aspx?sku=180757" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Final Fantasy Tactics A2</a>.   It follows the same world of FF12, FFTAdvance, and a few others.   It's a different story but it takes place in the same "world."   Anyway, FFTactics for the Playstation was really hard to play, but it was tons of fun.   FFTA (for the Gameboy advance) is easy to play and I think I am almost done with it, just in time for the next installment!

Unfortunately, I can't go out and buy games like I used to, so i may have to wait a while before I go out and get it.   Although, I got Ciriana onto a <a href="http://www.swaptree.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website for swapping books</a> with other people, but they also do movies, games, and music.   I put some of my old games on there in hopes of getting my hands on some FFTA2.   Heh heh.
