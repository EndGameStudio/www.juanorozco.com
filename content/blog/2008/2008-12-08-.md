Growing up all the other kids had their favorite type of music and bands, except for me.   My Dad listened to his music at work and it was really the only music I was exposed to, albeit only on Saturdays when he would drag me to work with him.   In truth, the music I really enjoyed wasn't on the radio, or played on MTV, it was video game music.   I didn't think of it at the time, but I really enjoyed video game music, and if it was a genre at the time, I would have claimed it as my favorite genre.

Now, I see the whirlwind of music being released by underground or independant artists all over the internet.   So much of it inspired by the love of video games and the music that accompanied them.   Video game music was considered as ultra-nerd about a decade ago, even though in Japan, gaming music was as popular as anything else.   The same music is now considered artwork by many, or, at the very least, an actual genre.   The music is finally accepted.   Listeners once considered "in the closet video game music lovers" are now free to express their love to the world without fear.

My brother and I would buy imports, or North American releases if available, of all our favorite games.   Especially Final Fantasy and the Chrono series.   Today, these tracks would play in my office and every now and then a coworker would stop by for something as I would be playing <a href="http://www.nobuouematsu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nobuo Uematsu</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasunori_Mitsuda" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yasunori Mitsuda</a> and they would ask me if I listen to classical music.   I would laugh and explain that the music was actually video game music.   For people to confuse it with classical music is awesome.   Some video game music is classical by nature, so the mistake is easy to make.   What I find interesting is that classical music is sacred to some listeners and I am sure they don't consider video game music the same as their music.   So, when video game music is mistaken for classical music, the truth is obvious: video game music is as beautiful and colorful as classical music, or any other genre of music.

I, unfortunately, don't go around buying $40 import cd's anymore, but it almost doesn't matter with all the musicians creating their own video game inspired music.   It really is exciting to be a video game music lover.   The music has reached a level where fans' voices are being heard.   <a href="http://www.play-symphony.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Play! A Video Game Symphony</a> is a concert that plays video game music all over the world.   It started in 2006 and became well known by gaming geeks very quickly.   For lovers of the genre, this was our event.   We had finally arrived.

The past few years, the video game music fanbase has grown in leaps and bounds.   <a href="http://guamaso.com/2008/05/09/college-band-video" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence</a> can be <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_qUpObkCgQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seen</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHn-L6odDP4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">everywhere</a>.

To this day, one of my favorite songs is Frog's Theme (Play Below) from Chrono Trigger.   (Sephiroth's Theme is a close second.)
