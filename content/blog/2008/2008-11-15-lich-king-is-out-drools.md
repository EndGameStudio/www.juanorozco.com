Here I am, sitting at my computer again, virtual-window shopping. Â  I'm staring at the <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/wrath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new expansion for World of Warcraft</a> like some little kid hoping that an onlooker will feel bad for me and buy it for me. Â  Damn online shopping...

Seriously, I would like to get my hands on a copy, but I am in no hurry. Â  I play the game for the story and the adventure - which is a nice way of saying I am not level 70 yet. Â  I started playing around April of last year and my main character, <a href="http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Sisters+of+Elune&n=Odiom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Odium, is currently at level 47</a>. Â  I have two or three characters in the mid thirties as well, but none of them are as fun, to me, as my Rogue (hence, RogueDad. Â  Sneaky sneaky). Â  I would be level 70 by now, but I have other commitments in life, that and I am slow...

So because I am such a low level, I can't take part in much of the new content. Â  Although, the recent patch introduced enough content and features to keep me happy.

Just out of curiosity, though, I logged in last night to see how the world was doing and I was really hoping to catch my first glimpse at the new class, the Death Knights. Â  I got on the zeppelin to Kalimdor and there's a crazy lookin' blood elf on her mount standing at the front, all dressed in black. Â  "Gasp" and "Rawr!" Â  Death Knights are _awe-some_ (especially female blood elves)!

The new patch and expansion introduced some new elements to the storyline as well as tons of other cool stuff, so I am really excited to see how this whole "war against the Burning Legion" turns out. Â  Until I reach level 70 and our finances pick up again, Wrath of the Lich King will have to wait. Â  That is, unless, someone would like to <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/guamaso-20/detail/B000VJTJNE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sponsor me... ðŸ˜‰<br /> </a>
