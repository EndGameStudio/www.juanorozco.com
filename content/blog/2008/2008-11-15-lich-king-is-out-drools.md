Here I am, sitting at my computer again, virtual-window shopping.   I'm staring at the <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/wrath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new expansion for World of Warcraft</a> like some little kid hoping that an onlooker will feel bad for me and buy it for me.   Damn online shopping...

Seriously, I would like to get my hands on a copy, but I am in no hurry.   I play the game for the story and the adventure - which is a nice way of saying I am not level 70 yet.   I started playing around April of last year and my main character, <a href="http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Sisters+of+Elune&n=Odiom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Odium, is currently at level 47</a>.   I have two or three characters in the mid thirties as well, but none of them are as fun, to me, as my Rogue (hence, RogueDad.   Sneaky sneaky).   I would be level 70 by now, but I have other commitments in life, that and I am slow...

So because I am such a low level, I can't take part in much of the new content.   Although, the recent patch introduced enough content and features to keep me happy.

Just out of curiosity, though, I logged in last night to see how the world was doing and I was really hoping to catch my first glimpse at the new class, the Death Knights.   I got on the zeppelin to Kalimdor and there's a crazy lookin' blood elf on her mount standing at the front, all dressed in black.   "Gasp" and "Rawr!"   Death Knights are _awe-some_ (especially female blood elves)!

The new patch and expansion introduced some new elements to the storyline as well as tons of other cool stuff, so I am really excited to see how this whole "war against the Burning Legion" turns out.   Until I reach level 70 and our finances pick up again, Wrath of the Lich King will have to wait.   That is, unless, someone would like to <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/guamaso-20/detail/B000VJTJNE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sponsor me... 😉<br /> </a>
