Just in case you were wondering, my birthday is coming up. I know it's hard to figure out what you want to get me, but fear not: I have created my wishlist. One item on my wishlist is my good buddy, Mario Mario. [Check him out here][1].   Keep a look out on more additions to my wishlist.   I will have a comprehensive list for all of you three people that read this thing.   So, don't stress out, I'll make it easy for you.
