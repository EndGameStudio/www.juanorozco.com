That's something you hear often during our car trips up to Grandpa's house.  Even though we try to ration toys to the children we still end up empty towards the last leg of the trip.  There have been times where we forget many of the toys from the start - it's those situations that the emergency toy would come in handy.  A bear, though? I guess, but what about an inflatable car!
