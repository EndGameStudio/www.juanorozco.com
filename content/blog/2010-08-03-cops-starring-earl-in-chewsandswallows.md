I was watching Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs with the kids and my extended family today. I can't remember how the book went, but the movie is pretty fun. Mr. T's excellent voiceover performance especially stood out to me. So much that I wanted more of his character, Earl.

I was thinking he should get his own movie, but that was a one time deal so I figured, how about a tv series instead? That's when the wheels started to turn.
  
How about a Cops style show but based in Chewandswallow and centered around Earl and his crazy gymnastic antics. Mr. T has this tongue in cheek sense of humor in the jobs he takes and I think this would be right up his alley.
  
Anyway, just a thought I had during the final scenes of the movie. You know, where he busts through the big tortilla chip at the end? Awesome. 😛
