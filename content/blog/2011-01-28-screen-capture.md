I was trying to find out how much money I have in my On Demand account and noticed that Amazon keeps track of every purchase I've ever made... including this gem:
  
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2727" title="amazonescreencap" src="http://juanthedesigner.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/your-orders-google-chrome-1282011-94742-pm-bmp.jpg?resize=460%2C203" alt="" width="460" height="203" data-recalc-dims="1" />
  
Now... what did I do with that calendar...
