One of my "intentions" last year was to read more. Unfortunately, I didn't read nearly as much as I wanted to. _Technically_ I didn't read much at all, I _listened_. Regardless, I am pretty happy that I set up the behavior to enjoy books this last year.

I used to read a lot more as a kid. These days, I don't have the time or don't want to sit idly for so long. I want to change that. Again, for now, I'm just happy that I'm giving my brain some different kind of creative food.

  1. The Power of Habit
  2. The Handmaid's Tale
  3. Kitchen Confidential (RIP Tony)
  4. Ready Player One (again)
  5. Outside the Wire
  6. Howl's Moving Castle
  7. Children of the Mind
  8. Artemis
  9. Hyperion (I think I finished this in December but can't remember...)

Hyperion is by far the best thing I "read" last year. Handmaid's Tale is **bleak** and disturbing as hell but kinda mind-blowing at the same time (I can see some of that stuff actually happening). Kitchen Confidential was important to me because I so love Anthony Burdain's views towards life. Oddly enough, I learned more about leadership from his book than I thought I would.
