I started writing React stateful components using ES Classes in late 2017. I tried to use functional components whenever possible but as soon as state was needed I shifted to a class. Here's how I wrote them back then:

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>class MyComponent extends Component {
  constructor (props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = {}
    this.onClickHandler = this.onClickHandler.bind(this)
  }

  onClickHandler (e) {
    // Do Stuff...
  }

  render () {
    return (
      &lt;div>
      &lt;button type="button" onClick={this.onClickHandler}>Click Me!&lt;/button>
      &lt;/div>
    )
  }
}</code></pre>

I'm not a fan of how the constructor contains so many directives. I also wish it was easier to test methods without having to mount the component.

I've been shown the following pattern and I like it more.

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>class MyComponent extends Component {
  this.state = {}

  onClickHandler: e => {
    // Do Stuff...
  }

  render () {
    return (
      &lt;div>
      &lt;button type="button" onClick={this.onClickHandler}>Click Me!&lt;/button>
      &lt;/div>
    )
  }
}</code></pre>
