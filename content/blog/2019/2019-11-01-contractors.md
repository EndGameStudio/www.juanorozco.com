I consumed a lot of words today about what is better, contracting or full time employee. Some articles written for the employer (who should you hire) and some written for the worker.

Yesterday, I felt that contract workers are too easy to manipulate and deceive. Agencies can get away with a lot and employers can claim ignorance.

Today, I am conflicted. Don't get me wrong, some agencies are still irresponsible in how they treat people - poor holiday coverage, poor health benefits, minimal (if any) PTO. But I now understand the intent a little more of existing laws.
