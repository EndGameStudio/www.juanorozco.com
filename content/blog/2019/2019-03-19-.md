The hike around the Overlook trail at [Raven Rock State Park][1] is a good beginner's hike with some nice visual rewards. This past weekend, we packed up the kids and the pups to test their endurance and stamina for a nice, slightly hilly three mile hike.

The little one, just about three years old, and the five month old puppies were the real challenges here. First, the pups aren't the most well behaved animals (they get better every day but they're puppies!). Second, we're asking a lot of the three year old. Three miles is a lot for tiny legs! She's a trooper, though, she loves hiking and has never let us carry her once she figured out how to walk.

With children and dogs, though, come snacks and with snacks, comes trash. We try our hardest to leave the parks with everything we brought with us. Not all people follow this simple rule, unfortunately.

It never dawned on me to bring a trash bag and collect trash as we walked around. As we were hiking, we ran across two volunteers collecting trash. We made sure to thank them.
