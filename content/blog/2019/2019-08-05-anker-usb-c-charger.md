Bought an [Anker USB-C charger][1] because I finally got tired of forgetting my one and only USB-C charger at home.

Apple 80 watt charger now stays at home with my [Anker powerline USB-C cable][2], which is actually capable of deliverying the full 80 watts (technically, 100 watts) from the charger, unlike the included Apple cable.

I always kept the 2 Amp iPad charger in my bag but with the new Anker, I don't need to. One charger to rule them all. The USB-A port on the Anker can do 15 watts, which ends up being about 3 amps at 5 volts. Not bad!

The Anker stays in my bag now. It can only do 45 watts to the laptop which _is_ a little low but all that means is that I'll be charging a little slower. If I ever have to travel, I'll probably take the 80 watt with me. Maybe. I really like the size of the Anker charger.

Other than the lower power rating, the only other downside is that I can't swap out the plug with an extension. Not a deal breaker but some people use that a lot, I think.
