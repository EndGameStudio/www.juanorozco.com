I didn't grow up with cable, it was too expensive for the actual channels we would end up watching. These days, though, we pay a small fee for almost anything.

As I type this, Grammarly is checking my crappy writing, Automattic's Jetpack keeps a watchful eye on my WordPress install, and Spotify is playing some music related to Lindsey Stirling. On this same laptop, I also have iCloud making backups, I see Day One back there with all my journal entries, and I'm thinking of switching from Bear Writer to Notion for notes.

We're in the subscription age, no doubt about it. Instead of paying a lot of money for a large package where we only use a small part of that package, we switched to paying a lot of money for many small packages - all of which we use somewhat frequently to very frequently.
