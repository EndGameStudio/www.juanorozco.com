I've never played any of the Witcher games and I jumped on the TV show because I'm a huge Henry Cavill fan. Watching the show, inspired me to read the book. Hearing Henry Canvill's passion for the source material is what inspired me to read the book. The book is amazing. I love the show but the book is way better. Not in a bad way, I just prefer the storytelling. The show is icing on the book.

I'm reading more to our youngest before bed. We have to start with Winnie the Pooh. I read this looong ago for the big kids and it is just hitting differently now in my 40s. So much philosophy in this book - I learned that it's not _really_ a kids' book because of this. That said, my youngest LOVES it and is now a HUGE Pooh bear fan, silly old bear.

We followed up Pooh Bear with some Roald Dahl... which, like Pooh, is hitting differently as an adult. Like, holy moly, Roald Dahl was _racist_. I had to skip a sentence about Mexicans because I didn't know how to answer the inevitable question from my kid. The story is slow. So slow, Aggie wanted to just finish the book because it kept dragging on James' sadness. Some chapters made it harder for her to sleep!

Special mention to all the Sly Flourish books. As a new DM, Shea's books are a great primer in setting fair and healthy expectations for myself and my players.
