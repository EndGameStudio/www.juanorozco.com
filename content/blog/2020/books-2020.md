My favorite read of the year is, by far, Creativity, Inc by Ed Catmull. So many great examples of hard decisions and transparency. Catmull talks about working with difficult personalities, difficult projects, and overcoming friction. Super important book as I continue to learn what kind of leader I want to be in my career.

Chief Joy Officer put words to feelings I've had about transparency and the role of leadership. It helped me understand the concerns I've had in past job roles and learn language on how to address some of those concerns in the future.

How to be an Antiracist by Ibram X. Kendi is an important book for society. I grew up with the rhetoric of "don't see color". Now, as an adult, I realize, although people meant well, being "color-blind" was not the best way to create a better society for all. I feel like the word "racism" is thrown around without real thought about how we're labeling something. Kendi really has given this a lot of thought and I learned a lot about what to expect from others and, most importantly, myself in regards to equality and racism.

Honorable mention to Minecraft: The Island, specifically the audiobook. Jack Black's performance sounded really good but I _really_ enjoyed Samira Wiley's read. She conveyed so much emotion. The story itself is fun but as a father, I appreciated the self contained ideas and ideals each chapter addresses. Great book for adults and yougins'.
