title: How I work remotely

With the sudden influx of remote workers, I thought I'd try to share the many things I've learned through my years of working remotely.

## Quick History

I am a software engineer, specifically, I work with teams to build the best UIs for people. I spend a lot of time talking with my team and the rest of my time creating deliverables.

My exact day-to-day has changed a lot over the years. I've used IRC, Hipchat, Slack, Cisco Teams, email, phones, and pretty much some form of everything else. I've worked from home, from my car, from coffee shops, airports, and coworking spaces. I've used Mac and PC. I've tried working from a Raspberry Pi and an iPad.

The constant is that I write code and work within a team. I'll try to approach what I've learned from the point of view just working within a team but remotely. Whatever people do of value within a company, other than coding, is probably outside my scope.

## Day to day

My time is usually spent in the following three categories (eh hem, in no specific order):

1. Watercooler
2. Brainstorming, communications
3. Problem-solving, building

Watercooler time is any time spent maintaining and building relationships with the people I work with. This is an incredibly important time for remote teams and it should not be dismissed. I'll go into that more in the future, though.

Brainstorming and communications although similar to watercooler time is different in that the goal is to make decisions or answer questions. More often than not, I spend more time here than anywhere else. While we are building we also have to think again and plan so this stage never really ends.

Problem-solving and build time is pretty self-explanatory. For me, this is coding time, code-review time, researching tools and APIs, etc.

## Core Beliefs

Everyone's experience will be different.

You will experience new levels of autonomy and freedom. It can be thrilling and rewarding.

To make the best of this, be productive, and be happy - decide on the following.

1. Keep an open mind. Make routines and expect to break them.
2. Check in on yourself. This is a learning experience. It's ok to mess up, you will learn to bounce back.
3. Know your tools and pipeline. Reduce as many variables as possible.
4. Know your team. Again, reduce as many variables as possible. Set expectations, revisit those expectations, and, again, know that you wont meet expectations right away - and that's OK.
5. Embrace distractions. Focus on work but remember to take breaks.
