As the resident stay at home parent, I am now in charge of many house duties.   Fixing the bed?   Me.   Cleaning? Always has been me.   Animal caretaker?   Me.   Cooking?   Me.   (I'm so gonna get hell for that second one.)   I don't mind these responsibilities, as a matter of fact, I enjoy most of them.   Especially cooking.   I'm not sure what it is, probably something to do with my geekyness, but I have so much fun creating meals from ingredients.

I do have to admit that cooking over a stove is an animal, but baking is a true beast!   Some would say the stove is a bit more difficult, but I say the oven is unforgiving.

I am starting with easy recipes.   A couple of weeks ago I tried some cookies by using a cake mix.   The recipe was on the box and I kick myself for not copying it down.   The cookies turned out great, a little overcooked - which is why I said "unforgiving" - but still yummy.   I could have used the recipe today, but since I didn't keep it, I had to result to the internet.

I found a recipe that sounded about right and went to work.   First I made a batch without <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">mushrooms</span> marshmallows since Ciri doesn't care for them. Side note: I must have some sort of dyslexia because everytime I want to say marshmallows, I say mushrooms instead.   It also seems to extend into my typing.   Not good.

Anyway, so the first batch came out a bit cakey; very soft.   I followed the recipe, but for some reason the cookies came out like cookie-shaped cake.   Although, after they had time to cool down, they did harden a bit.

My second batch included the marshmallows.   This is where I say the oven is unforgiving.   The mallows overcooked, lost too much moisture and became rock hard.   I tried to cook them longer so that they would come out like cookies and not cake.

Afterward, I met with my personal chef trainer - the wife.   She advised me that I should try heavy cream instead of milk and maybe use two eggs instead of one.   I made them for her so we could have a <a href="http://www.bjsrestaurants.com/desserts.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pizookie</a> for desert tonight and I am just glad they were edible.

My next baking attempt will be homemade granola.   Stay tuned for that disaster.   \*snicker\*   I need to give myself more credit.   Oy.

Here's the recipe, be warned: they may come out like cake-ookies.   I got it from Cooks dot com.

1 pkg. semi-sweet chocolate chips
  
1 stick butter, softened
  
1/2 c. walnuts or pecans
  
1/2 c. oatmeal
  
1 egg
  
1/3 c. milk
  
1 (2 layer size) cake mix, white for reg. cookies or chocolate for chocolate chocolate chip.

Get the <a href="http://www.cooks.com/rec/view/0,186,159189-234199,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rest of it at cooks dot com</a>.

**UPDATE:** I had some cookies yesterday from this batch and they were exceptional.   I take everything bad back about this recipe- it doesn't need to be changed.   I do remember having to cook them a little longer though.   Marshmallows are still a No-go.
