I knew that Nissan was my favorite.   It was so much fun driving that car, I just wish they didn't make the interior maroon.. yuck.   Now we have a 2001 Sentra for Ciriana and Izzy, but if we decide to have another child soon, we will need a car with a larger back seat.   Izzy's baby seat is HUGE, and there is no way we can fit two of them.

The only bad thing is that it has no Hybrid option (yet?).   We really want a hybrid for our next car with gas prices going up like they are.   The other option is a Ford Escape Hybrid or a Nissan Altima Hybrid, which the latter currently not being sold in North Carolina.   The Ford Escape doesn't get as good mileage as Hybrid sedans (obviously), but I would trade my truck in for that.   If we get a sedan, we will trade in Ciri's car, which should be about half way paid off by then, if not more.

One last point: the Rogue not only looks cool, but it's also named after my class of choice in World of Warcraft.   It's a win-win, man.   Now, if only they could make it into a hybrid.
