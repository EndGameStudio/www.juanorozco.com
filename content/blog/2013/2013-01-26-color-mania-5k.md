type: post

Not to be confused with [Color Run][1], Color Mania is hosting their own color run in April. Â Ciri and I are signed up and we will be bringing the kids.

This should be number two of my [committed][2]Â [six 5Ks this year][3]. Â It depends on if/when the [WordPress 5k][4] will be.

Info:

- Run/walk from what read.
- You get color thrown at you. ðŸ˜€
