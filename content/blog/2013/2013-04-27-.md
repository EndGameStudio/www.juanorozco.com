Last night, as a family, the kids and I experienced Dungeons and Dragons for the first time. A bunch of good friends crowded around the dinner table and set out on our first of, hopefully, many adventures together.

The kids mostly ran around as children do. I was intrigued in the mechanics and the gameplay. I love board games. Scratch that, I love games. What I REALLY enjoyed about last night was learning all the different mechanics and how that affects your strategy. Throw in the different personalities behind the players and how they choose to implement the characters stats and you have such a great dynamic experience.

It was late so the kids only got one turn before bedtime. Still, they got in a good hit with my Fighter. And it was enough to pique their interest.

This morning, they sat at the table and asked if they could play again. I don't have any maps or books to tell me about the monsters or everything else about the game. I guess I could make something up but would it be fun? I am mapless, would they mind a hand drawn piece of paper? I attempted to explain to a 4 year old and a 5 year old that we needed some things in order to play. It is not difficult to imagine how that went.
