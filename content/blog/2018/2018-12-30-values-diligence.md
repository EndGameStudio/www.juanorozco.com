Most worthy companies will describe their company values, either explicitly or through mission statement. Most companies start off with "how" they work; how they expect their people to "get things done".

Every job will have challenges, culture is how the team faces and overcomes these challenges. Sometimes you are expected to solve the problem on your own. Sometimes you are expected to NEVER solve the problem by yourself. Sometimes, you should just go with your fisrt instinct and iterate on it. Sometimes, you should just opt for simplicity.

Different employers use different language to describe these workflows but they all really fall into a few categories.

Every single category, though is a bias towards a constraint (like, prefer simplicity, for example). This makes the decision tree much simpler to traverse.

- Simplicity: Average time, less code, average quality
- Fastest: Less time, less code, less quality
- Efficient: Less time, more code, more quality
