I honestly hope that there is something after death. If not a place where the best of us get to hang out for eternity then at least maybe some step-by-step chart on how to reach a higher plane of existence.

I'm not against dying, I mean yea, the idea sucks. But I understand the role my body plays in the cycle of our beautiful planet. As scared as I am of it, I know that there's some cool things that I can do in my short time.

Still, what if it was possible to exist outside our physical constraints?

I watched Chappie and if you couldn't tell, it's **my kind of movie.**

I'll admit that the writing maybe wasn't that great and the characters were a little meh. But as far as telling a good, fun story - I think it did very well. Additionally, Chappie talks about two concepts that I totally geek out on, true AI and the transferring of consciousness.

The movie starts out setting up what consciousness is (or could be?) with the child-like Chappie (Sharito Copley), a robot created by Deon Wilson (Dev Patel). It's interesting watching Chappie's progression from infant to young adult. I mean, even that statement is interesting: we can't measure his consciousness by human levels, maybe she/he/it was still a child by the end of the movie! And don't get me started on Chappie's gender!

I digress. I really liked watching Chappie learn virtues and maybe even learn some vices. His decisions are intriguing, like helping "maker" survive a mortal woundby transferring his consciousness to a spare robot while "dying" himself.

The transferring of consciousness is the other portion of the story that gets me going. Let's say it was possible, would you allow yourself to be transferred to a robot body?
