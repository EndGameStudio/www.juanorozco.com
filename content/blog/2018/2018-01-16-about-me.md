I am a **web applications engineer** working in Raleigh, North Carolina. Originally from Ventura, California, I carry the ocean in my soul; my style is laid back but passionate.

I love photography, writing, and making things. I suppose if you need more I could also add husband, father, mild foodie, architecture appreciator, and tinkerer.

Put simply, though, I am a <span class="motto">wonderer, explorer, and creator</span>.

## Social {#social}

- [LinkedIn][2]
- [Github][3]

## Code {#code}

I publish a few things on [Github][3] and on [npm][4]. I appreciate any feedback you can provide!

## Writing {#writing}

I also do a little bit of writing...

- [ExitZaero][8] - Gaming and games.
- [Creative and Flow][9] - A magazine about creativity, exploration, wonder, and failure.

## More... {#more}

I try to keep my [about.me][10] page fairly current.
