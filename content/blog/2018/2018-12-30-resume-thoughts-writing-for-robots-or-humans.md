There seems to be two camps of resume writing tips: 1) write your resume to get past the robots or 2) write your resume for humans.

You can drill down each one and get different groups of thought but I think they all neatly fall into these two.

Personally, I think you should write your resume for humans but that's because I want to work for a company that values that connection. I understand this won't always be the case.
