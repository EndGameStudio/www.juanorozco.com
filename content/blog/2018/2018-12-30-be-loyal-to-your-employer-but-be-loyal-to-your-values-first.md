Keep your LinkedIn up to date. This isn't because you are not loyal to your employer. This is because you are loyal to your values. Sometimes, a company will pivot or simply evolve. In doing so, the company values may shift to the point where your values no longer align.

This happens. It isn't a bad thing, it is just life. Life is change. So, just be ready for it.

Make connections, stay in contect with old coworkers and friends, even old bosses.

Revisit your values often, maybe you'll find that it is YOUR values that have changed and it is time to change your environment as well!
