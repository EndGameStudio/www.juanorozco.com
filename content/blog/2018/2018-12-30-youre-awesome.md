It is interesting how often we question our value and set out to prove (or disprove?) our assumptions - which are usually low estimates. We constantly undervalue ourselves and find things that support this idea.

"I suck at work"

"My friends think I'm boring"

I often wonder why we do this? Perhaps putting ourselves above others might alienate us from the group, diminishing our chances of survival? Maybe, there's an underlying health issue?

> Quickly, regarding depression, if you have feelings of suicide, please talk to someone. Depression is serious and you are awesome. Please call ##### right now.

The irony is that I'm sure most of our friends, coworkers, family, and aquientences would place our value much higher than we assess on our own.

I've done it. I've been there. I have ADHD and can be more on the depressive side than on the hyperactivity side; I _feel_ things, as someone once explained to me. I feel my failures heavily. Yet, I feel the failures of my friends moreso.

It is hard for me to be in the middle of a depressed state but I immediately perk up when a friend confides in me. They discuss their issues and I can't but help set aside my own worries to help my friend.
