How _do_ you define the concept of life to a child?

Little Dood asked me the other day about gravity.

"Dad, so, how does gravity actually _work_?" After a short conversation about the mass of objects and how that mass affects other objects, I realized the capacity of children to process new information.

I think I do a great job explaining concepts to our kids. My measure for success is how they respond after I explain. Does he remain quiet? Probably not getting it then. Or does she ask more questions?

I have noticed that when the kids ask follow up questions, then the concepts are settling in and they're processing their stored experiences with this new information.

Sentience, life, and death are concepts we haven't touched on, that is, we haven't talked about the link between the three. Of course they understand death as being an end. Life as being not dead. Sentience, well, we haven't really talked about that at all, really.

Dood loves Transformers, especially their recent reincarnation as Autobirds and Deceptipigs. But, he doesn't understand that these robots are sentient like he is.

Bean loves animals, especially our cat, Safari. Where she is alive and makes decisions, does Bean really understand the difference between her stuffed animals and real animals?

I rewatched the trailer to Chappie, a movie about a robot given sentience and the following struggle to define that he is is "alive". It reminds me of Short Circuit but with an updated storyline.

I want to take the kids to see the movie but I'm thinking the violence is just too much for kids their age. My goal is to put a story in front of them that presents the question, "can something built be given life" in a way they can process.

I want to then sit with them after and hear their questions, because I know they'll have plenty. Once they realize that the definition of sentience, the definition of life, can be made vague, what possibilities are out there?

Can energy be alive? Can your conciousness transcend the material plane? Can our consiousness be downloaded into a hard drive? Does that make that other "me" a new person or my twin?

There are countless stories revlving around these different ideas and I can't wait to share them all with the kids and have conversations with them about all of it.
