What have you done in your life that you could call epic? Legendary? Ok, what about challenging?

Every year around this time I begin to hear the same word over and over again.

> Resolutions

And every year just before this time I also _don't_ hear anything about if those resolutions were completed or not.

Personally, I think starting something on some arbitrary date is ridiculous. It makes no sense. I mean, starting something without a plan is ridiculous anyway, but we bring it to a whole new level of ridiculousness when we start it at the top of the year.

If you're going to start something, start it on your birthday, I say. Then again, if you're going to start something... **start with a plan**.

## Challenges not resolutions {#challengesnotresolutions}

Resolution is a passive word. It means that you intend to do something. It doesn't really say how or when or even why. Before we can actually do the thing we need to do, we need to think about it differently.

A challenge is an invitation to do your best. Usually, a challenge is met after meeting predefined criteria. Framing a resolution in terms of a challenge is a mind hack. Resolutions don't mean anything anymore. A challenge can still be avoided and failed, especially if the challenge wasn't properly defined to begin with.

## Challenge levels {#challengelevels}

Some resolutions are more involved than others. Some challenges require training, discipline, and sacrifice. The more effort required, the more difficult the challenge, the more bragging rights one should be allowed.

### Hero Level {#herolevel}

Although a Hero level challenge requires exceptional effort, it is still something someone can accomplish within 365 days with some sacrifice or discomfort but it is something with a strong community around it. Something people have done and have documented it thoroughly for others.

  * Improve your health
  * Quit smoking
  * Get your degree

### Epic Level {#epiclevel}

An epic level challenge requires significant sacrifice and training. You could get hurt, lose financial stability, or really piss people off.

  * Start a business
  * Travel the world
  * Career pivot

### Legendary Level {#legendarylevel}

Something you might only be able to do once; something you could possibly **die** from; something that could affect the world around you.

  * Skydive from space
  * Build a working food replicator
  * Visit the south pole
