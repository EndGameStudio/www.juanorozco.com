There is no longer a difference between live action and animation, yet how excited are you about the following:

- Sleeping Beauty
- Ghost in the Shell
- Full Metal Alchemist

Odds are, you're excited about one of them, right? Whatever your driving force is, whether it is nostalgia, uber fan, or movie buff... the truth is, there really is no such thing as live action.

Yet, we're excited over the prospect of a live action movie from an animated source. What does live action even mean anymore? Most of these movies have to be made in a motion capture set. Actors sometimes don't really interact with each other directly. Scenery, foreground objects and atmospheric effects are almost all fake or at least digitally modified. Hell, even the car is fake now!
