I bought my iPhone 3G for many reasons. I liked the idea of consolidating many devices into one, but really, I bought it to take pictures.  I heard the camera was better than decent and the email capabilities would help me send photos to Flickr.

Then I discovered the App store and my previous notions on what I would use the device for went right out the window.

I have ten pages of apps on my phone now: two for highly used apps, two for games, two for photo apps, and the rest for random apps I somewhat use.

When it comes to photography, I found these to be my favorite and most used apps:

[**Hipstamatic** is a beautiful application][2] - a little pricey after you download all the additional packs (as apps go, anyway) - but beautiful none-the-less. Experimenting with the different lenses, films, and flashes makes taking a photo an interesting experience. I feel like a little kid again, running around with a new toy camera. The results are O.K. The resolution isn't that high and there are lots of artifacts from the processing. I honestly use it for the fun factor and if an update improves the resolution, wonderful - I'll still use the crap out of this app!

**Photogene, Photoforge, and Photoshop** are my editors of choice, although I spend more time in Photogene.

**Camera App (the stock one)** is very important to me. It's fast, it's simple - it just works. Yea, it could use a grid or a timer, but you know what? It is the fasted app to save photos.  I use it so much, that the shortcut (double home button) is tied to the camera as well as it taking up residence in the quick launch area.

**LOFI, Polarize, Edwin little, Best Camera, and Mill Colour** all have great filters for my images.  I'd have to say that I lean more towards the "lofi" stuff but I use all of these depending on how I'm feeling.  I really like LOFI's black and white filter, but Edwin little has some sweet borders.

I'll keep this updated as this page on my phone changes. Also, I am starting to update the photoblog more often as well.
