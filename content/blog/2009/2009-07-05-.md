In a world where hero’s only exist in comic books and movies, one man heeds the call of those in need.

He can’t fly.&#160; He can’t see through your clothes.&#160; He doesn’t have a cave, either. But he does have a gadget.

He is uncannily proficient with this trinket.&#160; This magical do-all device.&#160; Much like the Green Lantern had his ring, this hero has his own source of power.

Let evil beware; wrong-doers heed his warning; nay-sayers, say nay no more: iPhone-man, fueled by Wi-Fi and 3G, is the answer to the woes of the masses.

A young woman in need of finding an address, but unable to do so due to lack of awesomeness, iPhone-man pulls out his iPhone at “ludicrous speed” and locates the address with his trusty Maps app.&#160; Another citizen saved.

A young man yearning for the correct pronunciation of an insanely complex word, but unable to do so because he cannot access the global information repository known as The Web; iPhone-man to the rescue.

No cry for help goes unnoticed by iPhone-man, as long as they are within earshot. No fight for knowledge is fought alone with iPhone-man around.&#160; The world can sleep safely tonight, for iPhone-man is ubiquitous.

Sleep soundly citizens, iPhone-man protects his people.&#160; iPhone-man answers his people. Shh. Sleep.

iPHONNNEEE MANNN!!!!!
