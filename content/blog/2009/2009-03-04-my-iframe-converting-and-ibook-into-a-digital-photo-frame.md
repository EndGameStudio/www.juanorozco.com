I bought Ciri a digital photo frame for her birthday last year and she LOVES it.   We have gigs of images on the hard drive and I hate that they sit there <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG#JPEG_compression" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">degrading slowly into infinity</a> without ever being admired.   With Ciri's frame, at least the wonderful images we take can be enjoyed from time to time.   I wanted to buy myself one as well, but I don't like devices with only one purpose.   So I've been waiting for a digital frame that can browse the internet, display my Flickr feed, play my podcasts, etc. etc.   Does this device sound familiar?   Yup, it's pretty much a computer.

Why can't they make a digital photo frame that can display your images from social sites, like Flickr?   Why can't it play music from your networked PC?   Why, why, why?!?   I found the the perfect solution to my gripes via Instructables.   I can't believe that I never thought of converting a laptop into digital photo frame before.   It's such a great idea!   I have an iBook that just sits there collecting dust.   It smells like pits when it is in use, the keyboard is missing keys, and it does not run OS X 10.3 very well at all.   I was going to sell it on eBay, but then I realized I could use it to make my digital photo frame!

There's two issues I run into right away.   First is a frame.   Do I want to build my own, or should I try to find one that will fit.   Second is the software.   It has 10.3 loaded and it runs VERY slow.   But, it doesn't need to run very fast to load one picture from the internet every few seconds.   I really just need to find some software that will do what I want.

Right now, I am working on the software issues.   The frame design will depend on how I configure the hardware so I am focusing my efforts on getting a good software solution to work.   After days of searching I found that a lot of the software that does what I want will not install on 10.3.   My other option for software was to remove OS X and install Linux instead.

The goal is to have the frame on a wall in the kitchen.   I want it to go into "slideshow mode" when it is idle, but I also want it to be capable of playing music (either from my other computer or from the internet), and have access to the internet so I can read my feeds while I eat some breakfast.   Being able to read my feeds isn't as important as the first two objectives, but it would be a nice feature.   In the future it would be awesome if I could add a touch screen upgrade to it, too.

So, the first task is software.   I couldn't find any softare that would display my Flickr images that worked on 10.3.   Finally, i decided to just load it with Linux.

After trying three different flavor's of Linux, I finally got Debian to work.   I tried Kubuntu and OpenSuse but they either didn't support the PowerPC architecture or were just too difficult to install- at least for me it was.   The only experience I have with Linux is a few of months with Ubuntu.   It's not much, but I learned a lot.   Still very much a novice, though.

Anyway, Debian still required some tweaking to get it to work, but it wasn't beyond my limited skills.   I'll have more on that on my project site, Grojects.   Before I installed Linux, I researched some possible solutions for my software problem.   Linux actually had many different solutions and I am currently trying to find the best one that works for me.   Currently, I am working on configuring FEH, which shows the most promise.

The next step will be to remove any excess hardware and create a new case that will fit behind the frame.   For this, WEBSITE, had a PDF on how to take apart your iBook.   This is perfect, since I am a little scared of taking apart a laptop.   I also want to buy one of those weird flexible keyboards.   If I can, I want to place the trackpad and the keyboard on a pice of wood that can slide out from behind the frame.
