title: Cavemon, my Hunter in World of Warcraft
type: post
---

I started a new character a while back, a hunter this time. Â  I avoided the hunter class because a good portion of players chose it over any other class. Â  I can understand why, it's a simple class for beginners but also complex enough for experts. Â  I don't like doing what everybody else is doing, so I chose a Rogue instead.

<span>Well, I finally gave in a few months ago. Â  I made a troll hunter and named him Asbestos. Â  My server went up for a free transfer and I chose to transfer all my characters to a different server, when I did, I had to change his name to <span>Cavemon</span> since Asbestos was already taken on the new server.<br /> </span>

<span>I really want to create a complete back story for all my <span>toons</span>, but for now I just want to show off my little cat collection and give a small role-playing background too.</span>

### <span><span></p>

<p>
  Pringles the Ghost Saber
</p>

<p>
  </span></span></h3> 
  
  <p>
    <span><span>Pringles</span> was really the reason why I wanted a hunter. Â  He is a ghost saber, which is why he is somewhat transparent. Â  No other cat in the game uses this texture - when not in stealth. Â  That's why I wanted him, because of his unique coloring and transparency. Â  He's a cool cat, too, listens pretty good. Â  Loves his stomach being rubbed, which is weird because he is a ghost cat...</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span><span>Ciriana</span> was surprised that I didn't name <span>Pringles</span> after my real-life cat: <span>Jefe</span>. Â  I didn't think <span>Pringles</span> looked like <span>Jefe</span> at all, so I decided he needed a random name. Â  There was a tube of <span>pringles</span> on my desk and I thought it would make a neat name for a cat. Â  He is my favorite pet, but I am trying to focus on my tanking pet while I am questing on my own.<br /> </span>
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    <span><span>Jefe the Night Saber<br /> </span></span>
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    <span>So after <span>Ciriana</span> made me feel bad for not having a cat like my <span>Jefe</span>, I went out and found a striped cat. Â  For those that don't know, <span>Jefe</span> - or <span>Jefe'n</span> as we now call him thanks to <span>Ciri's</span> four year old brother- is a trouble maker. Â  I think he is half <span>savannah</span> because his stomach has spots and his fur is very soft, otherwise he is all tabby.</span>
  </p>

    <figure style="width: 192px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img title="Cavemon and Jefe" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3106/3131950169_14e48c850e_m.jpg?resize=192%2C240" alt="Cavemon and Jefe" width="192" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Cavemon and Jefe</figcaption></figure>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>So the virtual <span>Jefe</span> is a young cat with ADD and an affinity for causing trouble. Â  He loves taunting and annoying <span>Pringles</span> by running through him. Â  He also likes carrying <span>Ciri</span>, my pet crab, around pretending he is going to eat him.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    He is quite the handful.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    <span><span>Ciri the Crab<br /> </span></span>
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    <span>Can you guess why I named my newest tanking pet <span>Ciri</span>? Â  As I mentioned above, <span>Ciri</span> is a crab, both in-game and in real life. Â  ðŸ˜‰ Â  I thought it was a perfect name for my new crab and <span>Ciriana</span> does a great impression of a crab.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span><span>Ciri</span> the crab hates cats. Â  I found her on a fishing trip in <span>Duratar</span> after she gave <span>Jefe</span> the one finger salute. Â  Don't ask me how a crab is able to flip someone off, she just did. Â  After I tried throwing her back in the ocean, she jumped back out and followed me back to the city. Â  She is not my pet, she is just hanging around so she can kill <span>Jefe</span>. Â  Something about Jefe eating her family.</span>

    <p>
      Izzy the Gorilla</h3> 
      
      <p>
        <span><span>Ok</span>, so I don't really have a pet named Izzy just yet, but I will! Â  I'm going to get a gorilla as soon as I am leveled enough. Â  We call Izzy a little monkey and I thought it would be fun to have a gorilla named after Izzy in the game. Â  I know that gorillas aren't monkeys, but it's still funny.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>The gorilla I want is a baby gorilla, but from what I am reading it is untamable. Â  Which really sucks - it would be perfect since I am naming it after a baby. Â  I'll just have to find another gorilla that is somewhat cute.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Most likely I will have to get rid of my crab once I do get a gorilla since I don't have enough gold to keep so many pets in the stables.<br /> </span>

            <span><a href="http://petopia.brashendeavors.net/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Petopia</span></a> is a great reference for Hunters that need detailed info on the different pets in World of <span>Warcraft</span>. Â  Since I don't have the newest patch- Wrath of the <span>Lich</span> King - I didn't know they introduced new pets like rhinos and spirit beasts. Â  Â  After reading through Petopia I found out that the only spirit beast currently <span>tamable</span> by Hunters is "<span>Loque'naha</span>." Â  He's basically a cat, but with some different moves and an awesome coloring scheme!</span>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <span>I will role play this by</span><span> either</span><span> just adding him to my troupe, or by making <span>Jefe</span> into this cat. Â  I will release the cat I have now and rename this new one.</span>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <span>The story will be something like <span>Jefe was</span> hit by a car and the only doctor opened at the time was some crazy undead dude that turned him into a glowing bad-ass super cat.</span>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <span>This is a long ways away, since the beast is a level 76 elite and Cavemon Â  just barely leveled to 25. Â  I probably won't be able to tame this pet until at least level 75 and only with the help of others. Â  Plus he is a rare pet that only shows up every now and then.</span>
