I started a new character a while back, a hunter this time.   I avoided the hunter class because a good portion of players chose it over any other class.   I can understand why, it's a simple class for beginners but also complex enough for experts.   I don't like doing what everybody else is doing, so I chose a Rogue instead.

<span>Well, I finally gave in a few months ago.   I made a troll hunter and named him Asbestos.   My server went up for a free transfer and I chose to transfer all my characters to a different server, when I did, I had to change his name to <span>Cavemon</span> since Asbestos was already taken on the new server.<br /> </span>

<span>I really want to create a complete back story for all my <span>toons</span>, but for now I just want to show off my little cat collection and give a small role-playing background too.</span>

<p>
  Pringles the Ghost Saber
</p>

<p>
  </span></span></h3> 
  
  <p>
    <span><span>Pringles</span> was really the reason why I wanted a hunter.   He is a ghost saber, which is why he is somewhat transparent.   No other cat in the game uses this texture - when not in stealth.   That's why I wanted him, because of his unique coloring and transparency.   He's a cool cat, too, listens pretty good.   Loves his stomach being rubbed, which is weird because he is a ghost cat...</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span><span>Ciriana</span> was surprised that I didn't name <span>Pringles</span> after my real-life cat: <span>Jefe</span>.   I didn't think <span>Pringles</span> looked like <span>Jefe</span> at all, so I decided he needed a random name.   There was a tube of <span>pringles</span> on my desk and I thought it would make a neat name for a cat.   He is my favorite pet, but I am trying to focus on my tanking pet while I am questing on my own.<br /> </span>
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    <span><span>Jefe the Night Saber<br /> </span></span>
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    <span>So after <span>Ciriana</span> made me feel bad for not having a cat like my <span>Jefe</span>, I went out and found a striped cat.   For those that don't know, <span>Jefe</span> - or <span>Jefe'n</span> as we now call him thanks to <span>Ciri's</span> four year old brother- is a trouble maker.   I think he is half <span>savannah</span> because his stomach has spots and his fur is very soft, otherwise he is all tabby.</span>
  </p>

    <figure style="width: 192px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img title="Cavemon and Jefe" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3106/3131950169_14e48c850e_m.jpg?resize=192%2C240" alt="Cavemon and Jefe" width="192" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Cavemon and Jefe</figcaption></figure>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>So the virtual <span>Jefe</span> is a young cat with ADD and an affinity for causing trouble.   He loves taunting and annoying <span>Pringles</span> by running through him.   He also likes carrying <span>Ciri</span>, my pet crab, around pretending he is going to eat him.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    He is quite the handful.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    <span><span>Ciri the Crab<br /> </span></span>
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    <span>Can you guess why I named my newest tanking pet <span>Ciri</span>?   As I mentioned above, <span>Ciri</span> is a crab, both in-game and in real life.   😉   I thought it was a perfect name for my new crab and <span>Ciriana</span> does a great impression of a crab.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span><span>Ciri</span> the crab hates cats.   I found her on a fishing trip in <span>Duratar</span> after she gave <span>Jefe</span> the one finger salute.   Don't ask me how a crab is able to flip someone off, she just did.   After I tried throwing her back in the ocean, she jumped back out and followed me back to the city.   She is not my pet, she is just hanging around so she can kill <span>Jefe</span>.   Something about Jefe eating her family.</span>

    <p>
      Izzy the Gorilla</h3> 
      
      <p>
        <span><span>Ok</span>, so I don't really have a pet named Izzy just yet, but I will!   I'm going to get a gorilla as soon as I am leveled enough.   We call Izzy a little monkey and I thought it would be fun to have a gorilla named after Izzy in the game.   I know that gorillas aren't monkeys, but it's still funny.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>The gorilla I want is a baby gorilla, but from what I am reading it is untamable.   Which really sucks - it would be perfect since I am naming it after a baby.   I'll just have to find another gorilla that is somewhat cute.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Most likely I will have to get rid of my crab once I do get a gorilla since I don't have enough gold to keep so many pets in the stables.<br /> </span>

          <p>
            <span><a href="http://petopia.brashendeavors.net/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Petopia</span></a> is a great reference for Hunters that need detailed info on the different pets in World of <span>Warcraft</span>.   Since I don't have the newest patch- Wrath of the <span>Lich</span> King - I didn't know they introduced new pets like rhinos and spirit beasts.     After reading through Petopia I found out that the only spirit beast currently <span>tamable</span> by Hunters is "<span>Loque'naha</span>."   He's basically a cat, but with some different moves and an awesome coloring scheme!</span>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <span>I will role play this by</span><span> either</span><span> just adding him to my troupe, or by making <span>Jefe</span> into this cat.   I will release the cat I have now and rename this new one.</span>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <span>The story will be something like <span>Jefe was</span> hit by a car and the only doctor opened at the time was some crazy undead dude that turned him into a glowing bad-ass super cat.</span>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <span>This is a long ways away, since the beast is a level 76 elite and Cavemon   just barely leveled to 25.   I probably won't be able to tame this pet until at least level 75 and only with the help of others.   Plus he is a rare pet that only shows up every now and then.</span>
