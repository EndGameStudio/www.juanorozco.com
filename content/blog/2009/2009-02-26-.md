I love cooking.   It's good exercise (I don't prepare well, so i make constant visits to the fridge and pantry and cabinets and prep area...), it's fun, and it's very rewarding.   Mostly, though, I enjoy it because I love science.   The whole cause and effect theory really comes alive when you're cooking up a recipe.
