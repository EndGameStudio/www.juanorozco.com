It's a been a while since I last wrote an entry, a little longer than I would like.   I have a few posts waiting to get edited, but I've been so busy with the kid, the house, and projects that as soon as I sit down to edit my stuff, I start falling asleep.   🙂

For now, I just wanted to pop in and spill some details on [the coin design][1].   The dog bone shape design was picked as the winning design. Yay!   I got an email from the commander expressing his thanks and admiration for the designs.   He liked the coin a lot, but he had some changes he wanted done to certain parts of the design.

I've made the revisions and I believe that the final design is, well, finalized.   I'm not sure how long it takes to mint these things, but I wanted to wait on showing the final design until I had one in my grubby little fingers.   I'm curious how big and how thick they will be.   Some coins leave the metal exposed while others have a clear coating over the entire face - I wonder which they will choose.

Anyway, seeing the final design alongside the actual coin would be a ideal.   We'll see what goes down.

A quick note, I made a light box using <a href="http://www.thedomesticscientist.com/2008/07/15/quick-and-dirty-lightbox-tutorial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Domestic Scientist's instructions</a> and have gone picture crazy.   I posted the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/theguamaso/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best ones on Flickr</a>.   Take a look and tell me what you think.   I also took this opportunity to take the photos in RAW.   More on that later, though.   See ya.
