It's wishlist time. Last year was a pretty successful year for my annual personal holiday, I got Mario Kart, my sub-woofer, and a few other doo-dads. This year is a tough one for many people including my family and friends. I never expect gifts from them but they always ask what I want. It's also fun to just list the things I am excited about.

<figure id="attachment_1703" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1703" style="width: 150px" class="wp-caption alignleft">[<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1703" title="protocd100" src="https://i2.wp.com/guamaso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/protocd100-150x150.jpg?resize=150%2C150" alt="Protomen" width="150" height="150" data-recalc-dims="1" />][1]<figcaption id="caption-attachment-1703" class="wp-caption-text">Protomen</figcaption></figure>

One of my biggest things this year is creativity and art focused around the things I grew up around: video games, puzzles, and toys. One of my favorite art forms to indulge myself with is music. Lately, when I am on my computer, I'll be listening to Last.FM's video game channel. I discovered an awesome band called <a href="http://www.protomen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Protomen</a>. They're widely popular right now - and rightly so - their music is based on the Mega Man universe and has a real dark apocalyptic tone to it. Beautiful music. <a href="http://www.zambooie.com/stores/Detail.tpl?cart=12412698193666992&st_id=236&sku=PROTOCD100" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Me want</a>.

I'm also trying to return to my electrical-geek days by making my own USB powered LED lights. I bought a big bag of random LED's off of eBay some time ago thinking my parents still had my electronics toolkit that I left behind. Nope. My Dad must of taken it years ago. The only thing I really need right now is a <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/guamaso-20/detail/B0002ZPU6C" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">breadboard</a>. I'd love to get a new soldering iron, a bag of random resistors, and some perfboard... but that's for later.

While I am on the subject of electronics, I have been itching to play with one of those <a href="http://www.robotshop.us/arduino-usb-microcontroller-board.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arduino boards</a>. I like the LED email alert widget that can sit on a desk. I long time ago, I wanted to make a unit that attaches to the trash can that will send me a text message when the trash can is not on the street Monday night. It's an expensive idea that really outweighs any benefit I get from it, but that's how this geek rolls!

I have enjoyed photography for decades. I can't even say when I really started to love it - that's how far back it goes. I never took classes on photography, instead I learned and gained inspiration through the works of others. I bought photography books left and right. Today, I am doing the same with drawing and art. I'll take any good books on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_b?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=photography&x=0&y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">photography</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_b?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=watercolor&x=0&y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">watercoloring</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_b?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=pencil+sketching&x=0&y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pencil sketching</a>... anything. Books on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=graphic+design&x=0&y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">graphic design</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=typography&x=0&y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">typography</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_b?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=web+design&x=0&y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web design</a>, and pretty much anything design is also on my list. I'm absorbing knowledge like a friggin' Sham-Wow right now.

The last thing on my list are gift cards, specifically for downloadable content. I am really into the iPhone apps and WiiWare downloads, more-so than buying actual games at the store right now.  I think <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/giftcards/itunes/gallery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iTunes gift cards</a> work with the app store and <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/guamaso-20/detail/B000IMYL0U" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wii Points cards</a> are everywhere.

I'm trying to be good this year. Ciri says it's really hard to shop for me because everything I want is [very][3] [expensive.][4] As you can see, not one gift passes the $50 mark!  Yay me!
