title: Creativity and Art in My Family
type: post
---

My sister, Tanya, has been drawing since she was a little kid.Â  Her and my brother are part of the reason why I didn't push myself to sketch and draw more when I was younger.Â  They are much more talented and gifted than I am with the pencil and brush.

Speaking of creativity in the family, many of our uncles and aunts are VERY good artists.Â  My uncle Miguel has art all over my grandparents house using the Pointillism (or is it Divisionism?) technique.Â  They're amazing and beautiful paintings.Â  On my mom's side, a few of my uncles used to draw a lot of caricatures and other cartoon stuff.Â  The creativity genes exist from both sides of our family so it's no surprise that the four siblings are all creative in one way or another.

Anyway, so, Tanya posted a video on her Facebook profile that I wanted to share just to prove my point and to show off how good she is. ðŸ™‚

**UPDATE: Changed the video. This one has her coloring in the drawing.Â  MuchÂ  more interesting to me since I have trouble with color theory and stuff. You can see the rest on her <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ClandestineCultComic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You Tube page</a> and on the website I set up for her at <a href="http://moinoir.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MoiNoir.com</a>.**

She is starting her own web-comic soon and I am sure she will do well with it.Â  I put a link somewhere around here when she starts posting her comics.
