title: Online Web Apps for private journaling.
type: post

I've started up my personal journal again.  (Yes, I am writing a diary...)  Only this time, I thought I'd try a virtual journal in the hopes that I would continue writing in it longer than a few months.  I enjoy writing and chronicling my thoughts, but writing in a book never worked out for me.  I would jot down my thoughts and ideas more often if I could write from anywhere and anytime.  What better way to write on the go than with my iPhone?

The first thought I had was to search for some sort of iPhone app that was password protected.  I found a few, some free and some at a small premium.  Writing from the iPhone is convenient when there isn't a full size keyboard around, but I would rather use a computer when it is available.  So if I was going to buy an app, it would need to sync with some online service or at least sync with my PC.  I couldn't find any apps that had this functionality so I thought of just using a webapp instead.

Immediately, I found this cool service called <a href="http://penzu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Penzu</a>.  It's a very well thought out service and really simple to use.  It's completely private and, unlike a public blog, the individual entries don't have a URL for robots to scan.  Let's say someone figured out your password, each entrycan be individually locked and would therefore require a second password to view.

It's also well designed.  When you visit the site you can start writing right away by clicking on the <a href="http://penzu.com/pad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"try it out"</a> link. After you're done writing, just log in and it will save the entry automatically.  As you're writing, the text appears on what looks like a sheet of lined paper.  Like I said, really cool site.

Unfortunately, writing on it in Safari on the iPhone is really cumbersome.  I was typing pretty fast and after a while, I had to stop so it would catch up with me.  The site is really good, and adding an iPhone app would make it the best private journaling application I could find.  I ended up not using it because of how the iPhone interacted with it.

This search turned out to be a little more drawn out then I thought it would be.  I thought of  using <a href="http://evernote.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evernote</a> or the Notes app, but I thought I would look at Blogger and WordPress first to see if there was a "private" setting.  I created a blog at WordPress.com first and set it to private.  Using the WordPress iPhone app, I was able to log-in to the blog and start writing.  I checked to make sure I couldn't access the site if I wasn't logged in and that the RSS feed was not displaying either.  So far, this seems like a pretty good solution.

Evernote could work as well since I have the desktop application and the iPhone application.  It wouldn't be as  efficient since it's designed for quick note taking, plus I'm a huge WordPress fan so using the WordPress.com blogs is ideal for me.  <a href="http://blogger.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blogger </a>allows for private settings too, but I couldn't find an iPhone app for it.

I honestly hope that Penzu releases an iPhone app to go with their web application - I'll switch over if they do. Penzu is designed to be private unlike WordPress which is designed to be public.  Either way, WordPress is a good solution for now and hopefully I'll keep up with this journal-keeping quest for once.
