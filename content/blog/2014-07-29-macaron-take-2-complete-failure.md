I ran out of Cream of Tartar and used vinegar instead. I think my folding technique was better overall, I probably still didn't mix it enough.

The flavor spot on which was a bummer after I made some great chocolate Ganache.

I am holding off more experiments until I get more confectioners sugar and cream of tartar. I didn't like that I had to use vinegar mainly because it changes my process and it's hard to find patterns when there are lots of variables.

Still, I really shouldn't call this a _complete_ failure. I really shouldn't even call it a _failure_. I got really lucky the first time which was great for my morale. With this batch not turning out as good as the first, it has shown me what _not_ to do. And _that_ is not a failure.
