Almost a year ago I bought a new keyboard.  Not just any old QWERTY styled piece of plastic... no no - a solar powered wonder of technology.  Countless number of lines coded.  Thousands of emails written.  Numerous facerolls committed. Yet here we are - still ticking and kicking ass.

[Logitech K750][1] - very thin and solar powered.  The only thing that would make this better would be a palm-heat powered mouse to go with it.

I love my keyboard.
