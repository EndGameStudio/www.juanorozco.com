<img class="alignleft" title="My Moleskines" src="https://i1.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7188/6908568532_afa41c9eec_n.jpg?resize=239%2C320" alt="My Moleskines" width="239" height="320" data-recalc-dims="1" />My first Moleskine was a sketchbook with the thick slightly yellowish pages.  I love that notebook, but I felt it was too nice for daily stuff.  Target has some of their Moleskines on clearence so I picked up a pocket lined and a regular lined notebook. I also pre-ordered Lego branded plain Moleskine when they were announced.  I realized something in the past month... Moleskine's paper quality sucks.

I've been using my Lego Moleskine for a month now - jotting ideas, keeping project notes, sketches, et al. I use a Pilot V5 pen and I borrowed a friends fountain pen too - both leak through the page enough that I can't use the back page.

My lined notebook from Target is slightly better, but not by much.

I don't get it.  This is what Picasso used?  I'm being sarcastic, I know the two products are not the same. Still, it's frustrating to find out that these wonderful notebook's use sub-par paper.  I'm bummed.  Partly because I love the form factor and the simplicity and the ubiquitousness of the notebooks.  But mostly because now I have to finish the notebook before I try something else.

This [website has been helpful with researching my new future notebook][1].
