[<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2937" title="Black Big Jambox" src="http://juanthedesigner.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/video-placeholder.jpg?w=300&#038;resize=300%2C198" alt="" width="300" height="198" data-recalc-dims="1" />][1]It is odd to me that the designer of the Jambox also designed the new Big Jambox.  The Jambox is simple and almost utilitarian.  The Big Jambox with it's Jawbone badge and extra buttons and extra options is not the same.  I wouldn't even agree if you said it was an "evolutionary step" in the design.

I don't like it.

On the other hand, I can see how the extra controls would be useful.  The buttons have context just by their shape and positioning.

But... that badge.  Oohhh, that badge.

I loved that the original covertly mentioned it was a Jawbone product on top.  The product design sets this speaker apart from it's competitors - why do you need to have your mark on the front of it as well?  It pulls attention away from the detail and thought that went into the design. Keep it simple, a gentle reminder would suffice.

If anything, I bet it sounds pretty bad ass, though.  More air space, bigger drivers, more powah.  Obviously, I'm conflicted.

Actually, I'm not: I heart my Jambox. Just bummed out on the design of this iteration.
