  I want one of these, but only if I can print my own content to it.  I can imagine many uses for it at work for use in our current workflow.  I can think of even more uses for this at home... to do lists, meal plan/menu...

  What about giving one to parents? I can print out things remotely about the kids and stuff.  Can't do that right now, it seems, as it looks like they have it locked down.  It's not a printer per se.  Still, beautiful delivery of another method to consuming online content.
