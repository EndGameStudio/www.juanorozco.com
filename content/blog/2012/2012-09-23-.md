I love using Ubuntu.  I love using my iPhone. But what I really dislike about each are the headers.

Previously, designers had to keep in mind that users were still using a certain screen size.  Depending on the audience, the designer could assume a larger or smaller screen size.  These days, the designer must assume nothing - be flexible.  It could be 300 by 400 or 2 gazillion - who knows!?

Using limited space

With such uncertainty, one would think that utilizing every space and questioning the use of said space would be a priority.  If that were true, why is such a high percentage of my screen space used to display information I only access a small percentage of the time?

Guessing is a solution?

The Pinterest iOS app detects when the users is scrolling and hides both the header and the footer.  [What is this called????]  The algorithm for this continues to improve as sometimes it can be a little hokey - and getting the menus back when you need them requires a little guesswork.

Web browsers have full screen modes that take over all the screen space [all browsers???], but is that the solution?  What if I am working between multiple tabs?  CTRL tab does not display the title of the tab you switch to - there is no visual feedback like the OS's fast switching.
