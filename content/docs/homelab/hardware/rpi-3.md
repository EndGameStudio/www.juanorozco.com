I purchased some Raspberry Pi Zeros and a Cluster HAT. I wanted to learn Kubernetes and Cluster computing, and the RPi3 was a perfect solution. And cheap to build out, too.

### Previously used as...

- Home Assistant: Moved to Docker on the [Lenovo box](/docs/homelab/hardware/lenovo-m910q/)
- Speedify networking device: The NIC and processor are just too slow to deliver a good connection.
