- Intel Core i7 6700T 2.8 GHz
- 32GB (2 x 16GB SODIMM)
- 500GB Toshiba NVMe Drive
- 1TB Western Digital Blue SSD Drive

Running Proxmox, learning how to virtualize servers.

## Hardware Thoughts

Purchased on eBay for a pretty good price, although it was missing the SSD drive tray. I can upgrade the CPU to a 7th gen, max out the ram to 32 GB, and, with the purchase of an SSD tray, add another hard drive. No ability to add other cards like a NIC, though.

> I understand that the M920 has a PCI port that accepts some uprades and it also has USB-C ports.

Things to upgrade:

- [ ] CPU: i7 7700T
- [x] RAM: 2 16GB DDR4-2400 SODIMM
- [x] Drives: 1TB NVMe and 1TB SSD
- [ ] USB NIC

## Uses

I bought this to continue my goal of self-hosting and learning. The less I have to go outside of my network the better.

### Gaming

I haven't tried hosting a Minecraft or Impostor server yet but I know it is possible. I am more curious if I can run some emulation software to play my old games.
