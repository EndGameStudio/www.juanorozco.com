title: Homelab
---

I started my Homelab unknowingly when I purchased my Synology NAS so I could store and back up my photos. Fast forward to our current lifestyle roaming the States in an RV and it's started to grow finally.

### Goals

**Learning**. I want to learn about networking and infrastructure. It's super interesting! Dunno if I want to switch careers but it is something I've always been interested in understanding.

**Self-hosting**. I want to continue to own my data and take advantage of self-hosting to reduce how much bandwidth I use. Because we're nomadic, bandwidth comes at a premium.

### Current gear

- [Synology DS216J](/docs/synology-ds216j)
  - Two WD Red 3 TB drives
- [Lenovo m910q](/docs/lenovo-m910q)
