title: Lenovo M910Q

- Intel Core i7 6700T 2.8 GHz
- 16GB (2 x 8GB SODIMM)
- 500GB Toshiba NVMe Drive

Running Proxmox, learning how to virtualize servers.

## Hardware Thoughts

The cost of this device for what I got felt great. I feel a bit bummed out that the SSD drive tray was missing in this unit I think it will still last me a very long time. I can upgrade the CPU to a 7th gen, max out the ram to 32 GB, and, once I get an SSD tray, add another hard drive. I can't, unfortunately, add any PCI devices like another NIC.

> I understand that the M920 has a PCI port that accepts some uprades and it also has USB-C ports. That might be a better option although a bit more expensive.

Things to upgrade:

- CPU: i7 7700T
- RAM: 2 16GB DDR4-2400 SODIMM
- Drives: 1TB NVMe and 1TB SSD
- USB NIC

## Uses

I bought this to continue my goal of self-hosting and learning. The less I have to go outside of my network the better.

### Gaming

I haven't tried hosting a Minescraft or Impostor server yet but I know it is possible. I am more curious if I can run some emulation software to play my old games.
