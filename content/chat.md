Two of my favorite activities when it comes to software engineering are code reviews and whiteboarding sessions.

**Code reviews** are insanely fun for me because of the high quality knowledge transfer. I am a visual learner so stepping through the code with someone is incredibly helpful.

**Pairing.** Before we start working on a solution, I really like to pair with people to narrow down an idea. Whether that's on a whiteboard or just a one on one chat. These conversations are great because, again, of knowledge transfer. Both parties can learn new ideas or better ways of solving a problem making for a very productive session.

### Let's Pair

To that end, I want to try putting myself out there. I know code reviews and idea sharing usually come with concerns of intellectual property theft. I don't want to burden either of us with those concerns so reach out with that in mind.

I think we're all very sensitive to this, so I want to be as clear as I can: **I don't want your idea. I don't want your code. I want to learn. I want to share. That's it.**

If you want to try this experiment out, please let me know!!
