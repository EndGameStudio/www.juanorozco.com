Normally, I'm not attracted to games with grinding. After a time, it begins to feel like work. Yet, I have logged over 100 hours into this game and I enjoy most of it. I even pulled my kid into it and we sometimes go on raids together.

I enjoy building my base out, modifying it, optimizing it, and living in it. It's mostly utilitarian - I tried putting a bed and reading nook in one base and it felt weird. The character can't lay down. When they sit, they sit in a most uncomfortable way.

I stopped decorating for "people" and instead decorate for imagination. I love the Sandbike mechanic skins. I have a corner of my base reserved as a repair shop, Tenzin's Sandbike Repair and Restorations. ðŸ˜†

## Story line Status

I finished the first part of the main story line and now I'm just grinding away at resources for a bit to get some better armor and weapons. I read the first two books but I'm finding much of the story hard to follow - interesting, but hard to track. It's cool hearing about characters from the books. _Really_ exciting when I find schematics for Duncan's armor! I love playing the recordings to hear what is happening in this world and hearing them mention Rabban or Kynes.

## Ornithopter

I mostly got this game because I wanted to fly an Ornithopter. I have Flight Simulator but it's not fun playing that on my Steamdeck - I prefer my main PC. Playing Dune on my Steamdeck has been a lot of fun, even at low settings.

Unlocking the Ornithopter really changes the game meta - it kind of takes a lot of the fun out of the game but introduces new fun elements. The Deep Desert is interesting and beautiful. Dropping in on flour sand and spice sand then taking off when Shai-Hulud gets pissed at me, is simple but still feels a little exhilitrating when the worm breaches and then dives back in hungry and frustrated.

Flying an Ornithopter, although simplified in the game, is lots of fun. Especailly in Vulture mode.

## DLC

Although, I'm mostly in this game for the story, I do find certain mechanics enjoyable. I remember getting into Animal Crossing during Covid but quickly bailed because it was grinding for grinding's sake. Without the story of Dune Awakening, I don't feel the need to stick around. I'm glad to see that there's a DLC coming with more story, even though I haven't finished the main story yet.
